<p>Several days ago, Jeffrey Matulef discussed this mechanic <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35311/Analysis_Weakening_Heroes_And_The_Pursuit_Of_Progress.php">on Gamasutra</a>, to decent effect (mild spoiler alert in there, by the way). </p>
<p>More interesting than the article itself perhaps, is a reply by Craig Adams, aka Superbrothers, which I reprint below. Do be aware that there are absolutely some spoilers in here, so if you’ve not finished the game, you may not want to read through to the full page. Otherwise, look on:</p>
<p><i>“Super glad you dug our decisions re: The Scythian’s deteriorating condition in Sword & Sworcery.</i></p>
<p>S:S&S EP isn’t a mechanics-focused videogame, it’s closer to an audiovisual storybook… and as you point out in your article (with the Indiana Jones reference), dramatic stories in film or in books often end up with a broken & battered protagonist limping to the finish line… I would say this is a normal flow of an adventure story, and it’s only videogame stories that choose to do the inverse.</p>

It was at a very early stage, with only two characters in – the current build, which was shown at E3, now has three. </p>
<p>A couple of my friends from the beloved <a href="http://visublog.mechafetus.com/">Mechafetus Visublog</a> work there, and so I had occasion to visit their workspace, and poke around a little bit. I was particularly impressed by the chaotic whiteboard, which I understand they’ve been taking pictures of as it evolves, and may reveal those at the end of the project for interested fans. In the interim though, you can browse the photo to the left. It’s essentially an infodump from the artists’ brains. <a href="/content/2011/06/IMG_20110216_191409.jpg">Here</a>, you’ll find a detail of the little sort-of-comic-fragment in the middle. <b>Update!</b> Reverge has already started doing <a href="http://revergelabs.com/2011/06/whiteboard-wednesday-2000/">Whiteboard Wednesdays</a>, showcasing the art in greater detail, including <a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5275/5862256612_92a3aaf64c_b.jpg">this</a> awesome SNK section, with Athena and Ikari Warriors. It is amusing! The whiteboard I’ve linked to this post was only shown in part for the first installment of the series, so most of it hasn’t been seen before.</p>
<p>Skullgirls is coming “some time in 2011,” and our very own Vincent Diamante is the audio director now, Castlevania’s Michiru Yamane is composing, and Alex Ahad, Mariel Cartwright, Jonathan Kim, and Ouendan are doing art and animation, so at the very least, it’ll look and sound pretty neat when it comes out!</p>

<p>There are up to ten Japanese, Asian and Western games showcased yearly. Previous notable Western games that have also been Sense Of Wonder Night exhibitors —  with onstage presentations simultaneously translated to Japanese and English — include <em>Shadow Physics, PixelJunk Eden, The Misadventures Of P.B.

<p>Nowadays, Iwatani is a video game professor at the Tokyo Polytechnic University, which he talks about a bit as well. In 2005, he posted a book called “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%91%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E5%AD%A6%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80-%E5%B2%A9%E8%B0%B7-%E5%BE%B9/dp/4757717520">Pac-Man’s Methods</a>” in Japanese only, but told me he hopes to get at least parts of it published in the West. </p>
<p>Though I suppose a lot of people have these now, I took a photo of some of the original character design work for Pac-Man, done with graph paper, which you can see to the left. If you like, you can <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014631/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PAC">watch his entire postmortem</a> of the original Pac-Man, a talk he gave at GDC 2011.</p>

He was in the bay area for a little while, and I presumed he would be doing interviews with loads of people, so I talked to him for around 45 minutes in the Game Developer magazine office, then figured I should let him go to his next meeting, so as to not monopolize his time. Suzuki and his PR folks looked at each other and shrugged, saying “I guess we’ll get lunch!” Turns out mine was one of two appointments period, and I could’ve talked for as long as I wanted. Live and learn, I suppose. The results of the interview are <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6414/yu_suzuki_at_a_time_of_transition.php">here</a>, and looking back through it, there’s really so much more I could have and should have asked. </p>
<p>Getting him to warm up was interesting. In the middle of the interview, I had the random thought to ask him who he thought the best assembly-language programmers at Sega were, and this actually became a turning point, past which he was much more interested in speaking in general. In fact, he got so excited about programming that he decided to get out his laptop and show me several lines of code he had done for Shenmue Town in Visual Basic, which is his preferred language at the moment. Perhaps the best part of this code was a snippet at the top, which I will undoubtedly botch from memory. Here’s the gist of how it went:</p>
<p>FlightSim=False<br>
Battle=False<br>
Race=False<br>
FREE=True</p>
<p>You’ll note that he either pioneered or honed in 3D each of the genres mentioned. At the end of our meeting though, he shattered my expectations. After closing the code window, he moved over to a folder called “projects.” In there were no less than 10 work-in-progress ideas, about half of which were familiar Suzuki-led brands, appended with other words such as “shooter” or “experience.” The other half were entirely new projects. I won’t say what they were, because he asked me not to, but these aren’t just pie-in-the-sky ideas. He showed me videos of one game he wants to get funded, which had characters running around in a full world, and it was not the recently-semi-announced <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/34998/Yu_Suzuki_Signs_With_Premium_Agency_Working_On_Kinect_Fighter.php">Kinect fighting game</a>. Suzuki is definitely moving in a different direction with <a href="http://ysnet-inc.jp/">YS Net</a>, which I think will be a natural extension from, but quite different from his existing legacy.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.lzxindustries.net/bitvision">BitVision</a> is an audiovisual synthesis board that LZX Industries created a while back (when we weren’t posting, so this is okay!), in the tradition of Atari Video Music. If you’ve never seen Atari Video Music, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX1LVBLUYNs">here</a>‘s a nice man showing you what it’s all about.</p>
<p>The BitVision is intended for live performance, and simulates the color bleed and imperfection of a primitive 8-bit image on a CRT whilst displaying a 32×32 pixel image based on a 16 color palette, which is editable using the company’s provided tools. Many modulation capabilities are provided – as the company says, there is “<i>an analogue envelope follower and frequency counter track external audio signals and can modulate shape and color via many variable modulation routings. We wanted an audiovisualizer that could potentially provide live video for an entire musical performance, so 16 separate preset image/palette options are stored inside.</i>”</p>
<p>It comes in pre-assembled and kit versions, and continues on the long legacy of Atari visualizers, which has outlived the original Atari Video Music, and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrQOk7TseY">Virtual Light Machine</a> (VLM) on the Jaguar, to include Jeff Minter’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpmSA6pxCL4">audiovisual work</a> on the Xbox 360 (Neon). Below you can see the BitVision in action. Thanks to Jeff Fleming for the link.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> While the BitVision is sold out at the moment, I put in an email to creator Lars Larsen, who had this to say: “<i>We are building a batch of Bitvisions right now for Analogue Haven, which will ship sometime in the next month or two. We are small manufacturer so sometimes it can be hard to keep things in stock.</i>” So, simply play the waiting game, I suppose!</p>

		<p>Hey, since we’re in a <a href="/2011/06/23/happy-20th-birthday-sonic-the-hedgehog/">birthday celebrating mood</a>, I thought I’d dig up this neat piece of history from my stupidly large collection of old videogame magazines.</p>
<p>These are, as far as I know, the very first screenshots ever taken of the original Sonic the Hedgehog, from Sega’s display at the Tokyo Toy Show, June 7, 1990. The game was about two months into its fourteen-month development cycle, so there probably wasn’t very much there yet. </p>
<p>I scanned these from old issues of EGM (#s 13 and 16, for those playing along at home), so God only knows if EGM actually took these or if they stole them from a Japanese magazine. If anyone has a collection of Japanese mags from that era, take a look and let us know if there are any others.</p>
<p>The preview that accompanied these was pretty vague (“In Sonic Hedgehog, you control a super rodent on a mission to defeat the evil creatures that have populated your home.”), so I don’t know if the game was actually playable or if it was just a video feed or something. Regardless, it’s neat to see such an iconic game in such an early, embryonic state.</p>

<p>Sonic the Hedgehog turns 20 years old today. Isn’t that great? It’s also my dad’s 61st birthday, so that’s cool, too. Like my dad, Sonic the Hedgehog’s birthday occasionally falls on Father’s Day. This makes Sonic about as much of a father to you as my father is also a father to all of you guys.</p>
<p>To celebrate Sonic’s birthday, <a href="http://kotaku.com/5814830/happy-birthday-sonic-the-hedgehog-heres-how-not-to-suck">I did a Kotaku</a>. Forgive me! They offered money! The idea of the piece is that it’s “eight ways to fix Sonic the Hedgehog”, written for the target audience of a Sega who seems intent on doing the exact opposite of what people want. So I am reverse-psychologizing their reverse-psychology. It’s kind of stupid!</p>
<p>Though it has some fun sentences, maybe, like where I say chubbier, lighter-blue, black-eyed 1991 Sonic meeting darker-blue, longer-armed, green-eyed Sonic is “not as exciting as Superman meeting Batman — it’s more like ‘X-Men The Movie’ Wolverine meeting ‘X-Men Origins: Wolverine’ Wolverine.”</p>
<p>A more sincere, heartfelt “how to fix Sonic” article is perhaps this <a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=396"><em>Outrun 2</em> review from 2008</a>, in which I call <em>Outrun 2</em> the “16th best game of all-time”, and also “the best Sonic the Hedgehog game of all-time”, and I swear I am not <em>trying</em> to troll or be a jerk about that. It’s something I actually believe.</p>
<p>insertcredit.com exclusive: In commemoration of Sonic the Hedgehog’s 20th birthday, I made a Youtube playlist (below) of some of my favorite Dreams Come True songs. The bassist of Dreams Come True, Masato Nakamura, composed the (excellent) soundtrack for <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>, which is just a big, beautiful, boisterous, exuberant videogame full of confident graphical design. It’s probably the best <strong>actual</strong> <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> game — as far as I know, Brandon thinks so, too. (<em>Brandon’s note: As much as I like Sonic CD and its music, I agree with this statement.</em>)</p>
