Crazy though it may seem, IBM has done it at long last. The company has created a series of 3-mm wide <a href="http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4218883/IBM-demos-cognitive-computer-chips">cognitive computer chips</a>, the components of which are designed to emulate neurons and synapses even more than previous computer chips were meant to emulate neurons and synapses. And the proof is in the grey matter pudding, as $20 million in research later, IBM has achieved intelligent Pong AI, that holy grail of computing for lo these past 40 years.</p>
<p>As EE Times reports: <i>IBM envisions its cognitive computers solving a wide variety of applications in navigation, machine vision, pattern recognition, associative memory and classification. So far it has taught one to recognize a cursive letter “7” regardless of in whose handwriting. The other has learned to play (and win against humans) at the game “Pong.”</i></p>
<p>Success! And IBM is getting a new round of funding from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) to the tune of $21 million, presumably to enable the chips to learn to play (and win) at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg93nPgR6rw">Windjammers</a>.</p>
<p><b>Update!</b> Years ago, IBM created a freeware Pong clone, and released it on the internet. Was it training us to become better at Pong so that its computers could later best us!? Were we the unwitting beta testers? Has this been in the works since 2006-ish!? Any other conclusion is impossible! Play it after the jump! (because otherwise it would autoload and make annoying sounds)<br><a href="/2011/08/18/ibms-20-million-pong-ai/#more-4923" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

		<p>One year ago, Ex-Microsoft Very Important Guy Ed Fries decided to test whether he could still code in assembly, and decided the 2600 would be a great place to start. So it was that Halo 2600 was born – a top-down, multi-screen shooter with a high degree of sophistication for the console.</p>
<p>For those interested in taking a similar path, Fries has taken the next step. “I thought I’d celebrate the one year anniversary of the release of Halo 2600 at the Classic Gaming Expo by making the source code available,” said Fries in an AtariAge forum post. “It’s not particularly cleaned up or well documented but I put it here, as is, with the hopes that it will help some future 2600 homebrew programmers, just as I was helped by others who posted their code.”</p>
<p>Interested persons can find the code attached to the AtariAge thread <a href="www.atariage.com/forums/topic/185693-halo-2600-source">here</a>.</p>

<p>Glamorous as it may seem, the life of a game journalist is not always pleasurable. Among the many tradeshows and events we grudgingly attend, there are few more distasteful than the human catastrophe descending upon Southern California this July 21-24: the San Diego Comic Con. As my colleagues and contemporaries will testify safely under their breath, <em>SDCC </em>is the most unfortunate of all industry gatherings. This is because it combines two wholly countervailing elements: the industry and the masses. Unlike the fortified sanctum of E3 with its lavishly erected accoutrements and ample supply of complimentary alcohol, <em>SDCC</em> is a veritable feedlot for the most rabid breed of consumer livestock. How videogames became assimilated into this corporate merchandising unicomplex, one dare not consider. Indeed, resistance is futile: receiving the assignment to cover <em>SDCC</em> is akin to plummeting into the tarry abyss of journalism’s Rankor pit. Sampling the event’s many festivities – standing in various sorts of lines, mostly – is enough to break even the most hardened tradeshow survivor. This is precisely why the corporate afterparty, with its sub-Lunchables-quality hors d’oeuvres upon which we games journalists subsist, was created. But such oases of sanity are absent here, lest they be overrun by our arch nemesis: John Q. Public and his insatiable appetite for all manner of consumption. He is not alone. Jane Q. Public will make her presence known just as loudly, usually by way of a spandex superheroine costume displaying equal parts <a href="http://www.comicbookhotties.com/cosplayers/comic-con/pictures/?i=6935" target="_blank">cleavage</a> and <a href="http://www.comicbookhotties.com/cosplayers/comic-con/pictures/?i=6944" target="_blank">emotional problems</a>. What is there for a serious professional to do here? If all else fails, he can purchase myriad limited edition action figures with which to clutter his office cubicle in some quaint attempt at self-expression. But never before has an actual games journalist been immortalized in hardened petroleum byproduct. Until now. Not to toot my own horn, but beep-beep.</p>

<p><em>Fable fumbles toward excellence. There has rarely been such an obvious and concrete example of a genre’s awkward adolescence. It takes concepts other games have explored, serves them up in a new light, and hopes to be noticed and loved despite its spots and cracking voice. Fable is not a bold evolution of the genre so much as a necessary growth spurt.</em></p>
<p>I was the first person in the world who was permitted to review <em>Fable</em>. This is the final paragraph of the <em>Fable</em> review I wrote in 2004.</p>
<p>Some things never change: <em>Fable </em>is still very, very awkward.</p>
<p>In fact, right now, we’re in the most awkward part of the the <em>Fable</em> cycle — where the prior entry in the series has left us with <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6415/peter_molyneux_on_building_the_.php">disappointing memories</a> (“The real dream… The feeling that you’re going through the game at your own pace, but having to make these tough choices, was never actually realized”) and the newest entry is represented only by <a href="http://gamasutra.com/view/news/35552/Gamelab_2011_Molyneux_Addresses_Concerns_About_Fable_The_Journey.php">fulsome promises</a> (“[The addition of a horse to <em>Fable 4</em>] is going to have so much feeling for you. Just taking care of him, grooming him, and healing him, he’s going to be like nothing you’ve seen in games before.”)</p>
<p>With that in mind, it’s easy to forget that at one point, <em>Fable</em> seemed like it quite possibly might be the future of RPGs. This is something I believed in 2004.</p>

(Incidentally, it’s still <a href="http://www.caextreme.org/ticket_information">taking place tomorrow</a>, Sunday, in Santa Clara, CA, if any Bay Area folks feel like making an appearance!)</p>
<p>Although a lot of similar titles turn up year on year, CA Extreme is a gold mine in particular for early American arcade cabinets of the Atari and Midway ilk, from vector-based titles to limited-distribution prototypes. (The <a href="http://caextreme.org/games2011">game list</a> is semi-accurate, although there’s about 20% slosh in there of titles that didn’t make it, etc – since it’s all volunteer based.)</p>
<p>Some of the rarer titles on play have really got me thinking about the interesting experiments of the early arcade period — and what we can learn from them from a design perspective. So, here are the less obvious titles I played today that really spoke to me, and just why:</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9648">Space Dungeon</a> (Taito, 1981 – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQisVkzKiHw">YouTube video</a>)<br>
Apparently created before Eugene Jarvis’ seminal Robotron 2084, this is a frantic, Rex Battenberg-designed dual-stick shooter. And it’s a blast, once you work out which are the enemies and which are the pickups in the game (seriously, not that obvious!) There’s an interesting game design counterplay in going out of the way to grab pickups versus heading straight for the exit. Frenetic and unexpected.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8601">Major Havoc</a> (Atari, 1983 – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9UEuciaoM0">YouTube video</a>)<br>
One of a pair of absolutely mindblowing – and somewhat lesser-known – Atari titles from the prodigously talented Owen Rubin. Major Havoc is consecutively an interesting-angled Galaga style title, a swift Lunar Lander-style mini-game and a physics-heavy platformer, all using super-attractive vector graphics. Design lessons? Multiple genres in one game can really work, spinner-controlled physics is fun _and_ frustrating. And the main character has an idle animation!</p>

I had a couple of goals with this game. The first is that I had been researching <a href="http://www.aderack.com/game-maker/index.php?title=Main_Page">RSD Game-Maker</a>, a 20-year-old DOS-based development environment (see my <a href="/2011/06/30/from-shooter-to-shooter-the-rise-of-cly5m/">earlier post</a> about cly5m), and I wondered if the old tools would support a relevant, contemporary game. As it turns out — maybe!</p>
<p>My other goal ties into the weirdness of the old engine. I have long been fascinated with glitches, and the odd mechanical and expressive qualities that they bring to a game. I figured this was a chance for me to  explore the deliberate aspects of both of those qualities. You can play the surface game, and it’s fine — but until you start to pick away at the scenery, you’re only getting a part of the picture.</p>
<p>I won’t say that <em>Builder </em>is the most profound or involving game on the planet, but I’m pleased with it.  You can <a href="http://www.aderack.com/builder/">download it</a> for PC or Mac (which I have not tested; I have been told is a little slow), and you can make it work in Linux. There are more screenshots <a href="http://www.aderack.com/builder/screens.php">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZuQeDT3Sqo">here</a>‘s a play-through by Ken Taylor of the webcomic <a href="http://tsuduku.moosheep.org/">(tsuduku…)</a>. I suggest, if you plan on finishing the game, that you not watch past the first video.</p>

There are those little RSS icons at the bottom of each post once you click through, but if you need a link, <a href="/feed/">here</a> you’ll find the full feed to subscribe to, and <a href="/comments/feed/">here</a>, likewise, is a feed for comments, should you want that sort of thing. </p>
<p>As this is an otherwise purely informational post, I have attached a picture I just took in Barcelona of Richard Bartle’s cufflinks, which I quite liked. He’s essentially the father of MMOs, you know! Got a king on his left and an ace on his right, he has!</p>
