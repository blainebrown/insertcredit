		<p>For me, E3 started the Sunday night before, when I, along with most of the Insert Credit staff, almost died in an elevator. The floor indicator froze on 3, then jerked like a roller-coaster whiplash aimed directly at our bowels, then teleported us to 6 and did it again and again. Calmer minds suggested that due to the design of a modern elevator, they cannot fall; said calmer minds were still very much freaked out. We tried the call box. It didn’t work. We did make it out alive, and celebrated by watching that one episode of the Power Rangers where all ten Red Rangers show up in a single episode. I looked at Spencer Yip (Siliconera), who I had not said a single word to that entire evening, and said: “Nice to meet you. I’m Patrick Miller, and I will forever remember you as One Of The Guys I Almost Died In An Elevator With.”</p>

<p>We are in a business of creating and consuming recreational realities, and E3 is the supreme recreational reality, with tanks and free booze and hot girls paying attention to us just about everywhere. Our business thrives by trivializing death; we started the show by ever-so-slightly making eye contact with death, and then flinching. It kinda put things in context. It was a moment of clarity.</p>
<p>What follows are a few more moments of clarity from E3 2012. Read them, and you might never have to go to E3 again.</p>

		<p>Hello, friends! </p>
<p>It’s official: I have seen “The Avengers” more than once. I will not say how <i>many</i> times more than once I have seen “The Avengers”, because that would shatter my reputation as someone who hates almost everything. </p>
<p>I come to you today as a news reporter: the film references the classic Namco arcade shooting game <i>Galaga</i> during one of those scenes where Tony “Robert Downey Jr.” Stark (aka “Iron Man”) delivers a tightly scripted virtuoso monologue displaying his smartness and intelligence. “That man over there is playing <i>Galaga</i>,” he says, interrupting himself. “He thought we didn’t notice. We did.” Then he interrupts his own interruption of himself, slashing right back to the stuff he was saying about gamma radiation and government conspiracies. He does this all while wearing a “Black Sabbath” T-shirt — one featuring <a href="http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/nintendo-copied-black-sabbath-for-the-triforce.173391950/">an image of the Triforce</a> from <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>. He’s wearing a Black Sabbath T-shirt because they’ve already used the AC/DC song “Shoot to Thrill” to introduce Iron Man’s heroic swoops into action twice across three films. Here is where, maybe, the producers at Marvel Studios made that same error that the BBC’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmIjisnTpYk">Look Around You</a>” once made, when they flat-out called AC/DC “Heavy Metal”. “Iron Man”‘s producers might have been going for a subtler pun, though the takeaway is this: AC/DC is not heavy metal. They are not metal at all. They are classic rock. If you call AC/DC “metal”, you also consider Frito-Lay a food group.</p>
<p>When Stark’s monologue is over (thirty seconds after the “Galaga” comment), we see a quick shot back into the bridge of the flying aircraft carrier where The Avengers hang out and argue for half the film. (It’s pleasant-enough arguing (I saw the film More Than Once, after all (it was research: I wanted a deeper understanding of a logistical particulars of a billion-dollar-earning film which genuinely uses dialogue as an attraction and not a boring thing that the writers couldn’t figure out how to get rid of).))</p>
<p>There he is: a man playing <i>Galaga</i>! Man! Why the heck did it have to be <i>Galaga</i>? Why not <i>Pac-Man</i>?</p>
<p><a href="/content/2012/05/nameco.jpg"><img src="/content/2012/05/nameco-1024x764.jpg" alt="" title="nameco" width="300" height="224" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5061" srcset="/content/2012/05/nameco-300x224.jpg 300w,/content/2012/05/nameco-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a> Well, if you watch the credits of “The Avengers” — and who wouldn’t, when movie studios these days have to promise <i>two</i> post-credits fun-nuggets at <i>least</i> just to keep up with the Joneses — you’ll see, after the seemingly endless part wherein you realize they employed Literally Every Special Effects Company Out There, a “special thanks” section that expresses gratitude for all the usuals (fire department, police department, et cetera), and then . . . “GALAGA [TM] & NAMECO BANDAI GAMES [Copyright symbol] courtesy NAMECO-BANDAI Games America Inc.”</p>
<p>So, there’s that: the person tasked with typing up the credits for “The Avengers” didn’t spell “Namco” correctly. This means <i>Galaga</i> is not adequately credited in the film. This means Namco can probably sue. Hey, Disney and Marvel Studios — just settle out of court. Offer them five hundred dollars — they’ll take it. That’s enough for them to make another <i>Tekken</i> game <b>EPIC BURN</b></p>
<p>Oh: you want to see photographic evidence? Just click that image up there, bloggers of the world. Sorry it’s a bit blurry; my hands were shaking vigorously with the thrill of <i>Hot Scoop Action</i>.</p>
<p>Man! Imagine how many <i>other</i> typos there are in the credits sequence of this movie! The real title is probably supposed to be “The Avengrs”. </p>
<p>Serious comment: that no one caught that typo is a little jarring, and kind of says a tiny little thing or two about how even the legendary Japanese game developer who made <i>Pac-Man</i> never quite became a Real Mainstream Household Name.</p>

		<p><a href="/content/2012/05/takoashi.jpg"><img src="/content/2012/05/takoashi.jpg" alt="" title="takoashi" width="220" height="220" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5058" srcset="/content/2012/05/takoashi.jpg 220w,/content/2012/05/takoashi-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px"></a>John Cadice, creator of Tentacle Bento, says that while the game is full of sexy girls, and a “horrid, tentacle flailing, slime oozing monster from outer space,” his game is not about tentacle rape, but rather tentacle…tickling. And cake baking. Anything but rape.</p>
<p>Cadice says the game is a satire of a “horrid genre of anime,” but I simply don’t see the satire. It’s cuter, it’s lighter, but that does not a satire make. So I am meant to believe that while the game is based on the genre of tentacle rape anime, it is not <i>about</i> tentacle rape. There’s clearly a fundamental disconnect between our consideration of inference and implication versus intent.</p>
<p>I got an email from Cadice not two hours after my initial article, and within 24 hours the Kickstarter was canceled. We had a dialog all along the way, which was a very curious process. First Kickstarter limited the game’s searchability. The game was now only viewable through direct links. At the same time, my article, <a href="http://kotaku.com/5910304/come-on-a-card-game-about-tentacle-rape">as well as Kotaku’s</a>, had given the game greater media attention, and after my article went up the project rocketed up from $23,000 to $30,000 in funding. Clearly, as we scrutinized and criticized the project, we also popularized it. </p>
<p>After the project was canceled at Kickstarter, I wondered to myself – while I felt I had struck a blow against a game I found to trivialize rape and molestation, had I also struck a blow for censorship on Kickstarter? In the end, I feel this project shouldn’t have been allowed on the site in the first place – most of the approvals process at Kickstarter happens at the front end – it’s allowed, or not, based on what Kickstarter decides. I think this one simply fell through the cracks, and simply got canned much later than it should have. </p>
<p>I’ve been asked by some what part of the Kickstarter terms this game violates. It’s entirely subjective, but it’s <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/guidelines#">right here</a>: “Offensive material (hate speech, inappropriate content, etc).” There are some who don’t find this game offensive. Its creator claims the game is clearly not about rape or molestation. I maintain, based on looking at the Kickstarter itself, that it is, he just has a much higher threshold for it than I do. You could also make a case for it glorifying acts of violence, depending on which side of the “does this infer rape” argument you fall.</p>
<p>In the end though, I couldn’t stop the game from getting funded. The project had moved to its own site, and appears to be well on its way to coming out. I still maintain that the game is a trivialiation of rape and molestation, and that those supporting it are supporting that mindset. Cadice disagrees. In the following interview, Cadice speaks his mind about his project, and where he says it’s really coming from.<br><a href="/2012/05/17/the-boundaries-of-humor-an-interview-with-john-cadice-creator-of-tentacle-bento/#more-5053" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

It’s called <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1189988320/tentacle-bento-by-soda-pop-miniatures">Tentacle Bento</a>, and it is currently overfunded on kickstarter by $10,000. Go on and watch the video. </p>
<p>This is a game about tentacle rape – you are meant to “get your slimy tendrils” on as many girls as possible within the given number of cards. But there are other tentacle monsters out to rape girls before you can! And dastardly school officials who can get in your way! Just choose some girls (sexy, sporty, smart, et cetera), a location, and a “sneaky snatch” to grab them with.</p>
<p>The style is a cute, lighthearted, pastel-colored look at the wonderful world of forcing your way inside a female against her will. There are, to my mind, a lot of things wrong with this.<br><a href="/2012/05/14/tentacle-bento-and-kickstarter-when-no-regulation-is-bad-regulation/#more-5046" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

<p>“It’s so competitive when you play against another person.”</p>
<p>“It’s too hard.”</p>
<p>“You have to practice so much.”</p>
<p>“There are just so many good players out there.”</p>
<p>I hear these things a lot. The person I am talking to–let’s call him Johnny Doughnuts–is making an excuse, even if he doesn’t realize it, for why he isn’t as good at <em>Starcraft 2</em> as I am. Why he chooses to spend his time doing something else. And really, I don’t care. Some people want to get good at Starcraft 2, others want to get good at skiing or whatever.</p>
<p>But I do find it interesting that Johnny Doughnuts describes <em>Starcraft 2</em> as an anomaly. As though it is practically the only thing challenging–in life, in video games, whatever.</p>

<p>He told me to go ahead — but conversation quickly turned to why I like the <em>Tales</em> series so much, when he’d never been able to get into it. We started to talk about it, but we both quickly realized I should write about it instead.</p>
<p>The in-your-face anime aesthetic of the series is what turned him off. This is comprehensible. It advertises what the series is about; it’s a stake firmly planted, and depending on where you’re at, it just as much says “not for me!” as it says “come on in!” to the people who like it.</p>
<p>I’ll start where I started: I like the series because of what it’s not. This all began for me in 1998, when I’d got fed up with the tedious, self-important <em>Xenogears</em> and, on a lark, followed it up with <em>Tales of Destiny</em>. I found it to be everything <em>Xenogears</em> wasn’t: cheerful, dopey, energetic, unassuming, entertaining, fun.</p>

<p><em><If you are reading this strictly for tips on not sucking at ZiGGURAT, you can just jump down to the tip stuff <a href="#jump">here.</a>></em></p>
<p>I played a lot of <em>Diablo II</em> back in the day.</p>
<p>I actually didn’t get that deep into vanilla <em>Diablo II</em>, though. Beat the game on normal with a Conversion/Thorns Paladin, found myself woefully underpowered for Nightmare, and put it down until Lord of Destruction came out. That’s when I got addicted. Six months later, I had four high-level Assassins of various builds, a magic find Sorceress, and a Lightning Fury Amazon specced specifically for Cow Level runs. Yes, I made a character whose sole purpose was to mow down cows with alarming efficiency.</p>
<p>One decade later, I would reflect with some of my friends on our shared addiction to <em>Diablo II</em>. “Man, that game was addictive,” we said. Pause. Then I said:</p>
<p>“But, you know, it wasn’t really that much fun.”</p>

		<p><img src="/content/2012/01/occupy.jpg" alt="" title="occupy" width="166" height="250" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5016">Occupy Oakland is <a href="http://occupyoaklandmoveinday.org/">moving into</a> an abandoned building. While I have mixed feelings about being in an enclosed space (out of sight, out of mind), it’s true that people need to not be cold, and it could be an interesting place for discourse about homelessness, cooperatives, and everything the occupy movement is about. </p>
<p>It’s with that in mind that I direct you to <a href="https://www.wepay.com/donations/oak-u-tron-201x">this</a>. Anna Anthropy (aka Dessgeega from IC forums/Select Button) proposes adding an arcade machine to the new space, and will make a new game specifically for it. To do so, she needs funds. Unfortunately, the project was <a href="http://rpmcollective.com/2012/01/21/oak-u-tron-201x-banned-from-kickstarter,/">rejected from kickstarter</a>, and now has four days left to meet the goal of $2,000. If you felt like it, you could <a href="https://www.wepay.com/donations/oak-u-tron-201x">help make</a> an original occupy game happen in a rather interesting moment in a massive movement.</p>
<p>Here are some words from the project organizers that you can read: <i>“Every community center needs a game room to draw in the general public, to give people some respite and lighten spirits, and to give people an excuse to meet others in their community. And every good game room needs an arcade machine.</i></p>
<p>…if all goes will, the OAK-U-TRON 201X will be an official member part of the Winnitron Indie Game Arcade Network, showcasing the true, independent, DIY spirit of game developers around the globe!”</p>
