<p>Needless to say, I don’t play that many games these days. But I do play good ones, and I do play bad ones, so here we go: Patrick Miller’s Top Games of 2011, starting here.

It’s a story about a small game development team within its publisher, Irem. The team makes a series called <em>Disaster Report</em> – video games about surviving natural disasters. Just after the quake, the most recent game, Disaster Report 4, was cancelled, and all the previous <em>Disaster Report</em> games were  <a href="http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2011/03/29/disaster_report_production_halt">removed from Japanese shelves</a>, almost without comment.</p>
<p>But despite the garish way they’re marketed in the west, the <em>Disaster Report</em> titles were really quite slow and respectful games. Their subtlety is immediately visible in the trailers and Japanese boxart, which is soft and innocent. They don’t promise the thrills or graphical punch of some games. They only promise that they will try and show you what it is like to be a person escaping from a beautiful and welcoming environment that has suddenly become hostile.</p>
<p>In the games, you try to help people, but sometimes they die. There may be something <em>you can do about it</em>, something difficult and frightening. But often there isn’t. Coming to terms with this is evocative – it is not great art, but it is sincere.<br><a href="/2011/10/22/disaster-report-real-world-events-and-the-language-of-video-games/#more-4990" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

		<p>I was a particularly nerdy kid, growing up. I was raised by a single Dad who was plenty nerdy himself, and I usually opted out of sports-related activities in favor of playing as many video games as I could get away with. I have this excellent picture from my 8th grade Little League baseball team. On the day where everyone got action shots, I asked to have my picture taken on the bench, math binder in hand, since most of my game time was spent there doing homework. (I’m pretty bad at math, too.)Never in a million years did I think that I would be the kind of guy to watch other people play video games, cheer wildly, and yell “OH MY SHIT DID HE JUST DO THAT”. In other words, I never thought I’d be into sports. Until I went to Evolution 2004. That mass of roaring people cheering Daigo on? I’m in there, somewhere.</p>
<p>I imagine that attending Evo is, for a few brief days, a taste of what it’s like to be any average guy with a beer belly, some gym shorts, and a profound devotion to ESPN. A basketball fan can walk into any sports bar in the world and mouth off about how terrible the Warriors are and start a conversation. They can watch The Big Game with a crowd of people and not feel self-conscious about spending their time watching big guys play with big basketballs. And when they’re at work, they can say “So, how about them Knicks?” and everyone else is obligated to reply with “Hell of a team, gonna go all the way this year” whether they pay attention to basketball or not. Well, fuck the Knicks. Here at Evo, the name of the game is MAHVEL, BAYBEE.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s a brief trip into a world where taking games seriously is totally fucking normal.</p>
<p>So! You’re going to Evo next year.<br><a href="/2011/10/20/the-anatomy-of-hype-or-why-you're-going-to-evolution-2012/#more-4983" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

		<p>Grasshopper Manufacture once did a lot of work for hire — the <em>Shining Soul</em> games on GBA, <em>Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked</em> for PS2 — but in its post-<em>No More Heroes</em> rebirth as an iconoclastic and very independent studio, it seemed likely those days were behind it. Huge publishers like EA (<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>) and Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment (<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>) have engaged the studio to create big-budget original IP. Why go back to making anime games?</p>
<p>Anime games like <em>Evangelion 3nd Impact, </em>released this week for the PSP in Japan by Bandai Namco Games. (“<em>3nd</em>“, by the way, is a play on the word “sound” — “san” being Japanese for “three” and, of course, the Third Impact being a big event in the <em>Evangelion </em>universe.)</p>
<p>Is it the stewardship of Akira Yamaoka, who has recently taken the title of chief creative officer? Is it just the way the Japanese market works, where studios rarely turn down paying work that in the west would seem undignified? It’s not clear, and unfortunately, I didn’t think to pose these questions to Yamaoka when I spoke to him at the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>I was very curious about <em>Evangelion 3nd Impact </em>itself, however. It’s a music game based on the popular series’ recent <em>Rebuild of Evangelion </em>film series, which includes <em>Evangelion 1.11: You Are (Not) Alone</em>, and <em>Evangelion 2.22: You Can (Not) Advance</em>, and it came out this week in Japan. The Q&A, conducted at TGS, follows.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell me how the idea for <em>Evangelion: 3nd Impact</em> came up? Like, how you started making it?</strong></p>
<p>Akira Yamaoka: So how it all started is that Namco Bandai, they just threw out: <em>“Evangelion</em> — is there anything that we think we can work on together?” And so Grasshopper actually came up with a few other concepts, including the one that now is <em>3nd Impact</em>. “So an action RPG, and what about this music-based, rhythm-based game?” And from there on, everything just kind of moved forward.</p>
<p><strong>Are you a fan of the original show, or the new movies, or anything?</strong></p>
<p>AY: I don’t think I’d say that I’m a huge, huge fan. Not crazy about it. I just like it normally.</p>

		<p><img src="/content/2011/09/froelich.png" alt="" title="froelich" width="202" height="252" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4939">If I were smart, years ago I would have tracked down Dan Froelich and asked him what he used to write his funky CMF soundtracks for <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_of_the_Jungle">Jill of the Jungle</a></em>, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Winds">Solar Winds</a></em>, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargon">Xargon</a></em>, and other early Epic MegaGames stuff. Turns out I no longer need to, as he has written about his experience on his <a href="http://www.danfroelich.com/">website</a>. It seems he tracked his early game music in <a href="http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=AdLib_Visual_Composer">Adlib Visual Composer</a>, a program that spoke to Adlib’s Yamaha FM chip (not dissimilar from the Sega Genesis chip) using a combination of piano rolls and FM instrument banks. Those elements were later <a href="http://cd.textfiles.com/knowledgemedia/CONVRTR/MSDOS/ROL2CMF/">crunched together</a> into .CMF files for use with early Sound Blaster cards. To give a rare peek at the raw Adlib sound, Froelich has included <a href="http://www.danfroelich.com/videogamemusic.htm">clips</a> of his <em>Jill of the Jungle</em> score, exported into ProTools. Cool beans! </p>
<p>So for anyone who wants to write early 1990s shareware music, that’s how the experts do it. Or rather, how an expert did it. I’m sure there are other methods. </p>

I decided to research as far back as I could to find them all. We’ll start with 2000, when the show was still twice per year – I couldn’t find official confirmation for 1996-1999, so if anyone knows those, feel free to drop me a line. </p>
<p>Looking at the list, it seems that from 2009-2011, maybe someone new was in charge of the theme. That’s also around the time the mascot started showing up, and the English takes a marked turn for the unintelligible. But the first one in 2000 is no slouch! So, let’s be off on our gaming journey of heartful energy.</p>

		<p>A bit ago <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35500/Interview_Marvelous_And_AQIs_Big_Bid_For_Western_Expansion.php">I interviewed</a> Daniel Kurtz and Toshinori Aoki for Gamasutra. The article has just gone up, and shows MMV’s bid for retaking the global market, as they merge with AQI. The trouble is, many of Marvelous’ leading creators (Kimura of Little King’s Story, Wada of Harvest Moon, Ohshima of Sonic fame) have left, as has almost all of the Nier team (thus, all of Cavia), and much of the company line sounds like the same old things every Japanese company has said for the last 10 years. Global (read: Western) expansion, fewer, more specific core titles led by MMV’s production team and developed by AQI. </p>
<p>I’ve said most of this in the gamasutra article, but here’s some bonus text from the interview, since I cut a lot of it out. The discussion below starts out from the company’s discussion of creating and owning IP at Marvelous. It’s probably worth reading the Gamasutra post first.<br><a href="/2011/08/30/the-future-of-marvelous/#more-4932" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

		<p>Late last year, someone uploaded a 1982 ABC report on arcade games, and it’s unusually interesting. Here you’ll see inside Taito USA’s factory (the president is about the biggest sleaze I’ve seen caught on tape from that era), hear about “pac-man wrist,” and get some wise words about games and kids from an unusually sensible psychologist. That man deserves an award. And at the 2:30 mark, is “Burt Price” actually Will Wright with a beard? Sure looks and sounds like it! The whole thing is worth a look though, if you like your history.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best bit of this video is the revelation of an unreleased Taito USA arcade game called Toasters and Chainsaws, which was reportedly being made by “Rex and Mark.” Frank Cifaldi deduced that Rex is Rex Battenberg, and through him, I learned that Mark is Mark Blaszczyk. Unfortunately, Rex is the only guy I can get ahold of so far, and he doesn’t remember the game at all. I’ll be following these leads until I root out the truth, so stay tuned!</p>

		<p>QA is a very important part of a game team, and that’s often undervalued. So much so, that companies will still sometimes just hire anyone off the street. </p>
<p>3-year Sega veteran Mac Senour (1990-1993) has a number of interesting anecdotes on his <a href="http://aboutmakinggames.blogspot.com/">blog</a> about getting into the industry. One of the more interesting ones is about <a href="http://aboutmakinggames.blogspot.com/2009/10/who-really-says-your-product-is-done.html">valuing your QA staff</a>. In the article, he mentions that Sega had a particularly cavalier attitude toward quality assurance. Here’s an excerpt:</p>
<p><i>While I was helping them connect multiplayer,  I had the following exchange with one of them:</i></p>
<p>Me:  “Like boxing games?”</p>
<p>Tester: “Si.”</p>
<p>Me: “Every play any boxing games before?”</p>
<p>Tester: “No.”</p>
<p>Me:  “What were you doing yesterday?”</p>
<p>He turned to another tester and said a few words in Spanish and then did a pantomime that resembled digging, and said: “Ditch.”</p>
<p>Yes, they had hired ditch diggers to test games.</p>
<p>If anyone has the credits handy, please send me the valiant diggers’ names! And if so many ditch diggers were working on Sega games, it could explain why the roads have gotten so bad around here…</p>
