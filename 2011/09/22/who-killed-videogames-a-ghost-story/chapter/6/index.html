("(XP)" it explains, immediately initiating you to game-jargon.) "i got them!" you think. "yay! 'got' means means they're mine!" no, it's not yours yet: "click the XP star to collect it", it says, using the jargon it has just initiated you to, denoting that it is a "star", whereas before it was just "experience points", putting the whole sentence in green text. "get" and "collect" are not the same thing in this game. bonus tip: if you don't "collect" the experience points (by clicking them), the game will just give them to you anyway. </p></div>
