<p>That’s according to Sony Computer Entertainment president and CEO Jack Tretton, who said so <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/davidewalt/2011/06/17/playstation-chief-jack-tretton-how-to-sell-vita-navigate-clouds-and-debut-the-ps4/">to Forbes</a>.</p>
<p>“PlayStation 3 is really just hitting its stride,” he said in an interview published June 17, 2011.</p>
<p>This is very important news. It has been a long journey into stride-hitting territory for the PlayStation 3, full of many false starts and shattered dreams. Join us as tonight we look back on the history of the PlayStation 3 and stride hitting.<br><span id="more-4655"></span><br><strong>May 16, 2005:</strong> Sony reveals that the PlayStation 3 exists during a press conference at E3. It remains quiet in regards to an approximate timeframe to hitting any kind of stride or strides, perhaps waiting to see what analyst reactions would be before revealing such information.</p>
<p><strong>June 29, 2006:</strong> American Technology Research analyst P.J. McNealy speaks to videogame marketers at the MI6 conference, and makes a brave stride-related prediction. According to <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/news/ps3-complexity-could-hinder-yields">an article</a> on Edge Online written by author Edge Staff, McNealy said that he “expects the PS3 ramp-up to hit its stride sometime in 2007.” He also calls the PS3 “the most complex box that’s ever been built in this industry.”</p>
<p><strong>November 11, 2006:</strong> The first PlayStation 3 in the world is sold. Despite there being only wild guesses of a stride being hit sometime in the next 13 months, consumers line up in front of Wal Mart days in advance and occasionally shoot each other, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>February 6, 2007:</strong> Competition gets fierce as internet website PS3center.net <a href="http://www.ps3center.net/news/237/tflight-hotas-x-review/">reports</a> that PS3 competitor Xbox 360 is “hitting its stride,” while the PlayStation 3 is just “finally starting to get rolling.” Stock prices for Sony Corporation hit a 52-week low.</p>
<p><strong>August 13, 2007:</strong> Finally breaking its long and painful silence, Sony comments on the PlayStation 3’s stride status. Speaking to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/aug2007/id20070813_409882.htm">Bloomberg</a>, Sony senior VP of marketing Peter Dille says that the PlayStation 3 “will soon hit its stride and begin outselling its competitors.” Though his prediction of “soon” was vague, it came as some comfort to those early adopters waiting patiently and occasionally shooting each other, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>October 29, 2007:</strong> Everyone remembers where they were when the first shot was fired, as Napa Valley Register writer Aimee Green is the first to declare that the PlayStation 3 may have, in fact, hit its stride, saying in her memorable <a href="http://napavalleyregister.com/lifestyles/article_e2066278-a901-5248-85ca-cf7914302f3a.html">Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</a> review that “The PlayStation 3 feels like it’s finally starting to hit its stride.” Microsoft executives worldwide fly to a secret remote island to begin the longest emergency meeting in company history, lasting approximately 37 days uninterrupted.</p>
<p><strong>July 15, 2008:</strong> At E3 2008, Sony’s Jack Tretton makes a formal announcement at the company’s press conference, saying “The PlayStation brand is really hitting its stride.” Most publications immediately declare Sony the “winner” of the show.</p>
<p><strong>July 16, 2008:</strong> The very next day, rebellious Gamasutra editor Christian Nutt calls bullshit on Tretton, saying that the PlayStation 3 <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19433">“has not yet hit its stride.”</a> The phone lines at GameStop become impenetrable, as millions of consumers call at once asking for clarification.</p>
<p><strong>November 17, 2008:</strong> On the two-year anniversary of the PlayStation 3, Sony reveals that the PlayStation Network has hit its own stride, with company spokesman Jon Kollar claiming that it “has truly hit its stride” in an <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/11/17/happy-birthday-ps3/">official blog post</a>. This officially marks the first time that one console has hit two different strides simultaneously, thanks to the powerful Cell processor.</p>
<p><strong>November 19, 2009:</strong> Just in time for the one-year anniversary of the PlayStation 3’s two-year anniversary, a headline on <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/8646/buzz-developer-dude-reckons-home-is-hitting-its-stride-right-about-now/">PushSquare.com</a> declares that another PS3 service, PlayStation Home, is “Hitting Its Stride Right About… Now.” This marked the third stride developers were able to hit on the PlayStation 3, now that they were becoming comfortable with its complex architecture. A <a href="http://playstationlifestyle.net/2009/12/12/playstation-3-gathers-5-awards-from-spike-vga/">report</a> on PlayStation LifeStyle the following month confirms this, with noted author Richard Allen saying that “PlayStation has really began to hit its stride in many regards.”</p>
<p><strong>March 16, 2010:</strong> The gaming world is outraged as popular complimentary hotel room newspaper USA Today <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2010-03-16-godofwar16_ST_N.htm">reports</a> that the PlayStation 3 has in fact <em>not</em> hit its stride, saying instead that “Sony’s Blu-ray-compatible system <em>could be</em> hitting its stride.” The sidewalks surrounding Wall Street are coated in a sickly maroon that night as over 100 investors simultaneously take dramatic, slow-motion leaps out of their high-rise offices.</p>
<p><strong>July 1, 2010:</strong> NPD analyst Anita Frazier confirms that no, really, the PlayStation 3 <em>has</em> hit its stride, saying in an email to journalists and analysts that “the PS3 has <em>really</em> hit its stride [emphasis ours].” This comes as no relief to the families still suffering from their losses on Wall Street. A wake is held for the fallen investors, with <a href="http://youtu.be/n7TLTjqUyog">Collective Soul’s “The World I Know”</a> played on repeat.</p>
<p><strong>April 8, 2011:</strong> Finally breaking the company’s silence (though offering no apologies in the process), Sony’s Jack Tretton says that the PlayStation 3 is “just hitting its stride,” just under three years after telling E3 attendees that “The PlayStation brand is really hitting its stride.”</p>
<p>And that brings us to today, where Sony’s complex box is still continuing to hit its stride on a daily basis.</p>
