		<h1 class="indizar">Chapter 5: Too many notes</h1>
<p><strong>By Tim Rogers</strong></p>
<p>I had all of two articles posted on <a href="https://insertcredit.com">insert credit dot com</a> before I got my first email asking for advice on how to be a game journalist.</p>
<p>I was as confused by the request and what to do with my own life post-this-request as the young writer of the email had been about his own life before writing me an email.</p>
<p>My first two articles on insert credit dot com were trash. One of them was a sappy piece about playing <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> as a child. The other was an article proposing that <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> was postmodern literature, and Not Just Some Dumb Game.</p>
<p>Both of these articles were written with a certain person in mind. When I say “a certain person,” I’m not talking about a demographic or an idea. I am talking about an actual person — an actual, living, singular human being.</p>
<p>This article here is going to shape into a confession of sorts. I’ll get the hardest part out of the way right up top: The actual, living, singular human being I had in mind when I wrote my first two insert credit dot com articles was a person I genuinely disliked. Those articles were originally written as forum posts — note the clippy nature of their sentences; note the abundance of single-sentence paragraphs.</p>
<p>What I did, in turning those forum posts into articles, was cut out everyone else’s argument, leaving only mine. I did go to journalism school, you know — and I had a lot of fun there. I know how to write the heck out of a complete sentence, and I know how to hear arguments, weigh them, and then position my responses in such a way as to allow them to stand on their own as . . . something.</p>
<p>Before I get sidetracked — that happens most every time my fingers touch a keyboard — allow me to finish my point: I thought that a specific person on a specific internet forum was thinking too deeply about a particular aspect of a videogame, so I started, in the most flowery language possible, to talk about how <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> had transformed my young life.</p>
<p>The People Of The Internet call this “trolling.”</p>
<p>Some people hated it; some people loved it. Either reaction amused me, so long as the target of my trolling didn’t realize I was trolling him.</p>
<p>Later, Brandon Sheffield posted on a forum I frequented, asking for features for a website he was starting up.</p>
<p>A poster on this forum — god bless him — directed me to Brandon’s thread. “You should send him something!”</p>
<p>I went to Brandon’s website — this very website right here — and gave it a once-over. I liked that it had white text on a black background. It looked just slick enough — very 1999. I shrugged. I copy-pasted my <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> post into a Word document and emailed it to Brandon.</p>
<p>I am hopefully not a sociopath. If you meet me in real life and you don’t immediately try to kick me in the junk, I will be nice, pure, and genuine to you. Like any teenager who just so happens to be over thirty, I have some normal hobbies and some weird hobbies. One of my weird hobbies is poking the internet with a stick and then listening carefully to the words it mumbles in its sleep. To me, this — the internet, the idea of setting on-topic words into cyber-stone for the ages to look up or down on — isn’t real. It’s a little playground. If you take it seriously, you creep me out a little bit — probably as much as I creep you out. Let’s not agree to disagree — let’s agree that I disagree!</p>
<p>This possibly makes me a weirder-than-average person. I’ve been careful, however, not to turn this hobby of mine into something that gets me arrested or even questioned by authorities.</p>
<p>Eventually, the time came, and I sent Brandon my <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> thing. A couple of important-like people linked it on their blogs and websites. It got on Slashdot, for some reason. This amused me to no end.</p>
<p>The first six or seven emails I got about the <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> piece informed me that I was more or less the worst person on earth, and that I’d obviously never had sex. Even though I knew while typing the “piece” in its original forum-post format that it was bound — designed! — to rub certain people the wrong way, the intensity of the negative reaction perplexed and amused me with unexpected ferocity. I felt awake and alive, to know that some people out there were monumentally bigger, weirder jerks than I was. So began the spiral.</p>
<p>I don’t hesitate to say that “internet tim rogers” became my “alter ego” — rather than hesitate, I’m just not going to say it. I wasn’t looking for an escape from anything. I had — and have — little to no desire to leave a genuine, authentic, heartfelt copy of my life or thought-avatar in any internet space. I belong to myself, darn it!</p>
<p>I feel like saying as much is stepping away from my resignation to leave no key to my true self here on this website.</p>
<p>Anyway, this isn’t about me — except for the parts of it that are about me.</p>
<p>No, this is about Me As A Video Game Journalist.</p>
<p><b>II</b><br>
I am not a video game journalist.</p>
<p>My reason for getting on the internet and pursuing intelligent discussion on games was linked closely with my inability to understand what in blue blazes anyone on GameFAQs.com was talking about. Google was young then. We also had Ask Jeeves and DogPile and Webcrawler and AltaVista — one of them told me to go to The Gaming Intelligence Agency — TheGIA.com.</p>
<p>I went there, and I didn’t leave.</p>
<p>I appreciated the way their brief news posts would snap on a dime from bone-dry, clean sterility to wacky wit.</p>
<p>I lurked on their forums for all of my college years; I liked the way the people there talked about games. It was refreshing and neat. I sent letters in to Drew Cosner, the letters columnist, once accomplishing the magical feat of getting him to post a column made up entirely of letters I’d sent from multiple dummy addresses. (Even before insert credit dot com, I was a troll, a jerk, and a weirdo.) Drew Cosner and I, eventually, would end up roommates in Tokyo. That was a pretty big, unpredictable thing to me, back then.</p>
<p>I wrote some fanfiction for TheGIA.com. It was purposely not conventional at all. The only email I got about that fanfiction was to tell me that <em>some</em> people go to a fanfiction page to read <em>fanfiction</em>, and that I should probably stop <em>trying</em> to write fanfiction — that I should, in fact, stop writing anything altogether. This amused me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at school, I interviewed professional golfers and tennis players for class assignments. I was great at it.</p>
<p>It felt, back then, in my hobbies and in my career aspirations, like I was deviating from my dream. At age five I decided I would be a film director. So here I was, writing jokey prose about videogames as a hobby and writing about sports as a future career.</p>
<p>Somewhere during my college years, I decided to write about music instead. I have nothing against sports — it’s just, if the people reading my sports writing ever met me in person, they’d undoubtedly say something about how I didn’t look like a sportswriter. Maybe this makes me a bigger jerk: I don’t exactly want to not look like a person who does what I do for a living.</p>
<p>I ended up writing a novel, which was a culmination of years of studying Chinese history, Russian literature, sports writing, law, and Japanese animation. It also incorporated experience working in assets protection at a Target store. It was pretty good! I hate it, now, though back then I had suit-wearing jerks in all directions telling me I was going to be a millionaire. I started to believe them. I bought a car and went on a trip all around the world, like a real big jerk. There I am, in the back of my mind, twenty-one years old, leaning on the hood of a rented Mini Cooper parallel parked in downtown Munich on an ice-bright Sunday, the place empty like after a zombie apocalypse, me drinking an Orangina.</p>
<p>I went to Japan as an English teacher. I planned to teach for a little bit, just for the life experience. Then I’d quit, and keep the visa so I could stay there a little longer. That part of the plan succeeded, all the way up until “a little bit longer” started to turn into ten years. I worked as a manga artist’s assistant for a year, meanwhile screaming in a terrible hardcore band.</p>
<p>All this time — even in Europe, even in Africa, even on nights after shows in Saitama — I checked The Gaming Intelligence Agency’s forums and articles.</p>
<p>Then, one day, The Gaming Intelligence Agency shut down. Some of the writers started a new website, which had a new forum. The new site was flimsy and weird. The Gaming Intelligence Agency had been such a robust, polite tank of sea monkeys designed to tirelessly entertain me. Now here I was, bored. I dipped my finger into the pool: I started posting on the forums.</p>
<p>Not four months later, in the heat of August, I had a kid emailing me, asking for advice. How did I “make it” as a game journalist? Could I give him some pointers?</p>
<p>I told myself I’d try to limit the use of metaphor or analogy in this piece, because once I get started on that, I just can’t stop. Well, here’s one, anyway: Right up until I decided to move back to America in early 2010, the first question almost anyone ever asked me in Japan was if I was an English teacher. The second question was how long I had been in the country. Any answer other than a lie in the key of “five minutes ago” elicited their most sheepish disappointment. Some cousin of optimism renders every lost rube in every subtle situation a timeless, ageless virgin.</p>
<p>So some kid sees an article; he reads it; it moves him; it’s white text on black; the essay looks, to be certain, slicker than a GeoCities page (“GeoCities page” was unfortunately more than just a figure of speech back then); it is definitely slicker than something scrawled out on a legal pad; there’s nowhere he can click on the page to view a blunt, direct, big, bold-fonted, honest dismissal of the credibility or professionalism of this website’s staff. It must be totally legit. Some other cousin of optimism renders “no evidence” of one thing in one situation a timeless, ageless veteran.</p>
<p>Did this give me a responsibility to keep this kid believing what he believed?</p>
<p>I thought, what would the jerk who wrote this <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> article tell this kid? My article was sentimental and weird, and I was the jerk who flopped it out there. It moved this kid to want to do something with his life that would end up with him getting paid to do what he would gladly do for free. I was approaching the top of my own private rollercoaster, about to careen into the part where my life started cracking in half. I didn’t feel great about anything, and nothing quite hurt yet. I told the kid, hey, the best way to get started doing something is to just start doing it.</p>
<p>This, officially, started a dialogue. This kid didn’t have any money. He didn’t have a job. The army had rejected him. All he knew was that he liked videogames. I got the impression of him as a noble soul: he was afraid to compromise and do a job that didn’t enrich his life and his love. He wanted to write about videogames right now, and he wanted to do it for money.</p>
<p>Eventually, the question came: “Are you guys hiring?”</p>
<p>So, I learned The First Thing, and that’s that, if you’re a big enough weirdo, people assume that you’re getting paid to be such a big weirdo.</p>
<p>To be more subtle: if you’re a big enough weirdo, someone — or everyone — is going to assume that being such a big weirdo is an irrevocably essential element of your existence.</p>
<p>Nine years have passed.</p>
<p>Every time I go to a Gamestop, I pick up a certain magazine and flip it right open to the center. Seven times out of ten, there, staring up at me, is a review with that kid’s name in the by-line.</p>
<p><b>III</b><br>
The Second Thing I Learned came soon after the first; like the first, my understanding of it has deepened as the years have passed and the re-learnings of it have increased in frequency and velocity. You might as well call this one of The Laws Of The Internet: Regardless of their intentions in contacting you or their opinion of your character, the reader tends to be incapable of seeing a timestamp.</p>
<p>Maybe this only happens to me because my writing exudes such a timeless, loopy, and weird quality: I get emails every day, with gradually increasing frequency — gradually, as I continue to sporadically write new things and throw them out there, casting nets for fan- or hate-mail — from people operating, for better or for worse, under the convicted presumption that the thing of mine they read had just been written thirty seconds ago.</p>
<p>One of the more frequent emails I get — to this day! — is the “Can I sleep on your sofa?” email. I had once said, in an article on insert credit dot com, that visitors to Tokyo who happened to read that particular article could sleep on my sofa. That was eight years ago; the mails continue to roll in.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s a bad example. A better example would be the “advice” emails informing me of cheap places to sleep in Tokyo. These are no doubt related to my numerous semi-troll writings about being a poor jerk wandering the streets of Tokyo. These mails come frequently, from people telling me that “capsule hotels” are “cheap” and “conveniently located” all over Tokyo.  Many of these people say that they themselves haven’t been to Tokyo, though they have friends who went, and that they got by just fine staying in capsule hotels. I’m sure these people mean well and are only trying to be helpful, and I’m also sure that their “friends” who have been to Tokyo are actually characters in William Gibson novels.</p>
<p>Or maybe I’m just the target of a long-going private joke.</p>
<p>Well, to clarify, I am the target of many, many long-going private jokes. One of those is to go to a particular article I wrote — which was as insincere and stupid a troll as any — and copy any given paragraph. Then, these people paste one of those paragraphs into an email to me. Then they send the email. That’s it. That’s the “joke.” I get that one two or three times a day. Once or thrice I tried to find the forum thread where someone successfully encourages more than one person to do this; five minutes is never enough time to find it, and my mind wanders to something else.</p>
<p><b>IV</b><br>
To be clear and at least a little bit true, despite my many writings saying I hate videogames, I am only about as serious as The Replacements are in their song “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBh5ZtATqOY">I hate music</a>.”</p>
<p>“I hate music<br>
Sometimes I don’t<br>
I hate music<br>
It’s got too many notes.”</p>
<p>I think videogames have too many notes.</p>
<p>Somewhere between the infantile trolling and the adolescent trolling of my early times at insert credit dot com, people who didn’t see the black background and immediately presume that we were edgy because we were cash-loaded enough to seek the savvy of marketing masters started contacting me, presuming I was plopping out all that weird trash because of career aspirations. They started asking me to write edgy, weird, as-negative-as-possible things for their publications.</p>
<p>I stepped my trolling game up to the next level, only now I had people giving me “permission” to push buttons and up the ante.</p>
<p>Game magazines glow, as a rule, more often than they smolder. The videogame marketing people bring them muffins and copies of games that maybe no one is capable of enjoying. The enthusiast press dutifully reports because they’re getting paid and it beats waitressing. My role was to be enough of a jerk, to ride in on a name — really, any name would do, so long as it was attached to a jerk. I didn’t make their writers look “good” so much as I made my own job look “easy.” Most importantly, my job was to make their writers look like the good guys. It amused me that they were promising to pay money for this.</p>
<p>Of course, the money never came. I tried to not let that bother me. A certain magazine still owes me around 4,000 British Pounds. That’s enough money to choke a rhinoceros, at the very least. I’d love to have that money, though hey, you know what? Maybe I don’t deserve it. Maybe no one does.</p>
<p>The typical unspoken counter-argument to “why aren’t you guys paying me?” was always (and by “always,” I mean “never”) “a thousand kids would line up to do your job for free.” Whenever I played out this imaginary conversation in my head, I thought about that kid who asked me if he could write for insert credit dot com. I told him to just start writing. He said he wanted to know if he was going to get paid. I told him I wanted to know if he could write.</p>
<p>It’s worth reiterating that, before anyone offered to pay me to write about videogames, someone was asking me if I could pay him to write about videogames.</p>
<p>Also for the record, the first time I ever saw pornography was <em>after</em> I had had actual sex.</p>
<p>So there’s that one thing — that conviction that one doesn’t want to pursue a career in something that doesn’t interest him. We don’t all want to work in steel mills; some of us would rather grimace at a stack of unpaid bills than pay those bills with our frustration.</p>
<p>Well, someone pays that kid a salary, today, so good on him.</p>
<p>Games magazines taught me that I didn’t like videogames as much as I wanted to. I had previously played awful games for fun, and I had played great games again and again to revel in them. It was the B-grade, mediocre titles that magazines sent me to review, however, that inspired the note-taking process that fueled the review that got me my first game design job offer.</p>
<p>(That was my review of <em>Jak 2</em>. (I’d so be driving a Lambo right now if I’d taken that job. (I’ll be right back — I have to go hit myself (again).)))</p>
<p>The process is simple: I take notes while playing a game. I do this for every game I play even today. The more I like it, the more critical my notes are. I don’t necessarily <em>try</em> to be negative: all I do is try to think of the funniest reasons nothing in the universe (or, the videogame in question) is perfect.</p>
<p>Shortly after I started writing intensive reviews for a multitude of magazines, I realized that I could, as a game designer, probably make any one of these mediocre videogames better. I still didn’t try to make it a career. My career as a fiction novelist slipped to the back burner. My aspirations to be a rock musician wouldn’t go away, so when I got job offers in California, I neither accepted nor turned them down. I wordlessly asked them how long they would wait, and they all wordlessly replied that they wouldn’t wait forever.</p>
<p>So far, in my life, nothing has lasted forever. No one has waited for me forever; and here I am, still waiting forever for something. There you have it all.</p>
<p>I kept writing about games and I kept not getting paid. My magazine articles grew increasingly focused and razor-sharp. I got offered columns; I got asked to write features about living and gaming in Japan. I said I wanted the Japan stuff to be under a name other than “tim rogers,” and no one would have any of it. They wanted the same guy from insert credit dot com, so I gave it up and, as one forum post put it “descended into self-parody.” When is writing as this century knows it ever not self-parody? Here I struggle to recall what Francois Truffaut said about “the cinema of tomorrow” having an audience of roughly the size of the creators’ combined or overlapping circles of friends. The man wasn’t (just) talking about YouTube.</p>
<p>The Second Thing I Learned kept coming back to bite me: The more focused and intense “normal” stuff I wrote, and the more prolific “tim rogers” became in the magazines of Great Britain, the more emails I got about my <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> Article “dreaming in an empty room.” The most frequently voiced opinion was that it was not a review, and that I obviously possessed an anus full of Satan’s demon semen to call it a review.</p>
<p>Bafflingly, the article did not call itself a review. The header of the article clearly calls it a “feature.” So this is The Bigger Part Of The Problem.</p>
<p><b>V</b><br>
The Bigger Part Of The Problem, if “the state of written material concerning videogames” is a “problem,” is that the people whose opinions are loudest genuinely dislike anything resembling dissent. “Popular opinion” is a thing which orbits a mass of aesthetic principles which conglomerated and solidified a short while before we started talking about things the way we currently talk about things.</p>
<p>I have heard people say that they read my reviews on my game review blog <a href="http://actionbutton.net">Action Button Dot Net</a> twice — once before playing a game, and once after. I have heard people say that they will immediately, after seeing an old film for the first or tenth time, go to Roger Ebert’s website and read his review. People want to reinforce their own opinion. I am sure that many psychologists and philosophers have written about this before me: People typically review products on Amazon.com only if they intend to give it an overwhelmingly positive or negative review. Linguistic communication beyond the Infant’s Cry Level is an unnatural and weird behavior, generally speaking. Funneling your linguistic thinking parts into an opinion concerning a thing which, by the laws of the universe, ought to probably be left alone or ignored (as it does not concern food, water, air, or shelter) is an even more labyrinthine, bizarre procedure.</p>
<p>The idea of “objectivity” appeals to a journalist for reasons we’re best not getting all the way into. They want to report what is real, as a means of understanding and knowing what is real, and helping others understand what is real. By recording facts of an event unseen to the reader, a journalist makes himself the proprietor, the owner — in the reader’s eyes — of information concerning a thing that may well — again, in the reader’s eyes — be fictional. I could put on my Jerk Hat, delve deeper, and come up with a half-baked proof that facts are, in fact, most of the time, opinions.</p>
<p>The most common response I get concerning my articles or reviews on Action Button Dot Net or Kotaku.com, today, are overwhelmingly negative. From the beginning, I’ve understood what it is I do that rubs people the wrong way. Pretending occasionally to be a “writer” has offered me an opportunity to watch people tick, twitch, and flop, and to understand the reasons for their reactions more deeply than before.</p>
<p>For example, once, in a forum post, I commented on some finer points of <em>Halo</em> — I was talking about how much I liked the control of the Warthog (this was in 2002). I mentioned, at the end of the post — which was of a fair length — that I was going to go get another Sprite and play some more. Not two seconds after that post came a comment from a person who deeply disliked me: “We don’t care about what beverage you’re drinking. Keep things on topic, please.”</p>
<p>Needless to say, this amused me to no end. I went on to, at every opportunity, mention foods and beverages in every review or videogame-related article I wrote. I wrote this terrible article about <em>Animal Crossing</em>, which continues to be parodied and result in hate mail. I mentioned at the very beginning that I was heating up a vegan burrito in the microwave. I tell you what — not five minutes after that article was posted, I had an email telling me to fuck myself, and to fuck my fucking vegan burrito. This never stopped being funny.</p>
<p><b>VI</b><br>
As time went on, people I knew in real life tried to tell me I was being defensive when I said that I kept offending such people because I didn’t want them reading my articles, anyway.</p>
<p>Eventually, I realized, I wasn’t defending myself. I didn’t want those people reading my articles.</p>
<p>“You could reach a much wider audience if you’d just rein yourself in,” people have been telling me, very recently, of my articles on Kotaku.com. “Write shorter articles,” they all said. “Make the point clearer.”</p>
<p>The point? What is the point? The point is that I’m a jerk. If you don’t have the patience to “hang out” inside one of my more labyrinthine internet pieces, enjoying the playground scenery and understanding that it’s all just a weird joke, I don’t really want you in there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the people of the world, we are many generations raised on <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, <em>Donkey Kong 64</em>, and <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>. We don’t want 99% or even 100% — we want 102% or 103% of our life experience. If we like something, we want all of it. So some frustrated people struggle through my writing.</p>
<p>I’m not just talking about myself: I’m talking about everything. We all suffer for what we love. To love is to suffer, and to suffer is to love — or to love suffering, et cetera.</p>
<p>My alternate argument usually includes a quip about how I am, frequently, and with great vigor, dropping solid-gold game- or level-design ideas in my pieces, and that I don’t want the six-second-attention-span-having rubes behind most of the awful mainstream trash out there to be able to just open one of my articles and pluck out The Precious without applying at least a little bit of brainwork. So rather than erect obelisks, I build labyrinths — stupid, frivolous labyrinths.</p>
<p><b>VII</b><br>
By not compromising, by being neither direct nor sincere, I have turned myself into an unemployable wretch by my own standards; my only choice of solid career is to make my own company. Nonetheless, even several years after the foundation of my games review blog <a href="http://actionbutton.net">Action Button Dot Net</a>, magazines the world over offer me full-time jobs as reviews or features editor. Usually the job offers come via emails asking for my phone number. Then I get a phone call, during which the editor invariably says, “You’ll need to rein it in a tiny bit.”</p>
<p>Being asked to rein it in a little bit isn’t the part that bothers me. The part that bothers me is that people still seem to be presuming that I want to do this for a living.</p>
<p>Well, in a way, I do want to do “this” for a living. Only the public face and the professional face are different.</p>
<p>See, I am a professional game designer. Somewhere between that <em>Jak 2</em> review and the formation of Action Button Dot Net, someone in Japan offered me money to sit around critiquing their game designs. I gained a reputation. I kept taking notes while playing games; I kept learning more about games; I kept turning my notes into articles — which grew into <a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=630">psychedelic text-labyrinths</a> as I found myself with more time to play, critique, and think, and less time to edit and polish.</p>
<p><b>VIII</b><br>
Eventually, I was hardly lying when I said I didn’t like videogames anymore. My vote of no confidence in the Modern Videogame is to spend the majority of my free time — when I’m not designing videogames — reading books or watching movies. If I play games, it’s usually something old, something really old, or something independent.</p>
<p>The topic for this essay, as mandated by my favorite man-date Brandon Sheffield, is “modern videogame journalism.” I don’t want to talk about that too much, because I’ll offend some people that I know and don’t dislike. I’ll be as gentle as I can: Modern videogame journalism is ruining modern videogames, and the majority of You People Writing About Videogames would serve the world better by getting a job at a 7-Eleven.</p>
<p>The average game journalist either has no hobbies other than videogames or fancies himself as so sophisticated and eternally correct beyond mainstream comprehension as to dismiss everything as trash. (If I were a game journalist (and remember, I’m not!) I’d certainly be the latter.)</p>
<p>There’s that Pauline Kael quote about being unable to appreciate great art if we can’t appreciate great trash. That’s most of it: Games as a medium — communication as an idea, more like — is a gelatinous mass of maybe-nutritious something-or-other, and it is what you make of it.</p>
<p>Did you know that Metacritic is <em>the</em> tool for game development now? Game designers, despite their deepest wishes and loves, will more often than not have a producer standing over them, saying to not borrow or expand on that darling feature in their misunderstood favorite game unless said game has at <em>least</em> a 70 on Metacritic. I am defecating you negative here. I worked at one of the most “edgy” game developers at the world, and surely enough, when it came time for the game design section to start submitting pitches for new games, the producer offered the following advice: “Get on Metacritic right now. See what’s been reviewed most recently. Arrange them in descending order of score. Read the review blurbs on the pages for games with scores over 80. Keep a list of keywords mentioned in multiple reviews. Give that a couple hours. Then start work on a one-sheet game design document. We’ll meet to brainstorm and expand on your ideas on Monday.”</p>
<p>I can’t help thinking about the uncompromising kid who sent me that letter, begging for my advice. He didn’t want to fill jam jars for a living. He wanted to be around videogames.</p>
<p>Not everyone in the magazine gets to review the new <em>Zelda</em>, and that’s why there are so many game magazines. More often than not, you will meet a game journalist when he’s a little bit tipsy, and he’ll tell you that he personally doesn’t care about <em>Call of Duty</em>, though the PR people are real nice and hey, the fans love that stuff, so <em>bam</em>, there’s a ten out of ten.</p>
<p>If you want my advice about writing about games, here it is: Ask yourself why you want to do it.</p>
<p>In my case, my answer was that I just like picking things apart, and there were some games that I liked, and that I wanted to make my own games, just because I could.</p>

Some kid friended me on livejournal.com. Me and my friend Chuck Franklin ran into him at <a href="http://www.insertcredit.com/news/e3_2004/tim/img/5.jpg">E3 2004</a>. His name was John Swisshelm. He went by the handle “Ninja Boy John.” He was a great kid. He didn’t ask me for advice on anything. He didn’t ask or beg to shake my hand. He didn’t immediately ask me about my articles. We walked around E3; we demoed some games. We talked about what we liked and what we didn’t. He was an intelligent kid who had, naturally, gravitated toward someone he liked, and that made me like him.</p>
<p>I ran into him in 2010 at the Game Developer’s Conference in San Francisco. He was about a foot taller and fifty pounds lighter than when I’d first met him. He was working for EA.</p>
<p>A year later, I ran into him at the 2011 Game Developer’s Conference in San Francisco.  He’s now a game designer at Naughty Dog. I friended him on Facebook: There he is in a scuba suit with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>A few years before this, the secretary in my office informed me that I’d received a package. It was a massive, Christmas-wrapping-paper-covered box. I tore it open. It was a package from Infinity Ward, containing every region and every version — PC, PS3, Xbox — of <em>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</em> in existence. The wording on the Christmas card was precious.</p>
<p>That very day, an email arrived at my @actionbutton.net email address. The subject line was “Your Bioshock review”. I’d given the game <a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=371">two stars</a>, and said that it was “the bare minimum” we should expect, and not the high water mark others touted it as.</p>
<p>The text of this particular email was:<br>
“Do you have cancer?”<br>
I replied, immediately, dropping a pebble into the rabbit hole:<br>
“No.”<br>
His next reply came with breathless velocity:<br>
“Why not?”<br>
In short, the real question is, who am I, and what have I done?<br>
The short answer is that I am somebody, and that I have apparently done quite a great deal.</p>

When I was a kid, I had a friend named Carl. He’s on my Facebook, now. Hi, Carl.</p>
<p>He liked <em>Dragon Warrior</em> more than any game. He played <em>Final Fantasy</em> every once in a while because it was the cool game that people were talking about, and besides, it was similar enough to <em>Dragon Warrior</em>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nintendo Power</span> was the god of everything game-related, back then. One day, the new issue arrived, and I shared it with Carl. In the previews pages was a blurb on <em>Final Fantasy II</em>. There was a picture of the status screen. There was a picture of Cecil.</p>
<p>“Dude!” Carl said. “Cecil is only on level <em>one</em>, and he already has <em>two hundred hit points</em>!”</p>
<p>Many years later, I was designing a videogame. You’ll find that game design is one-percent “eight-year-old’s letter to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gamepro</span>” and ninety-nine percent first-year algebra. It’s all about filling in numbers — determining values, tweaking values, deciding ratios and curves for random number generators, et cetera. If this sounds awful to you — seriously, don’t become a game designer.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy it more than most other things.</p>
<p>I think about Carl and that issue of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nintendo Power</span> almost every other day when I am tweaking values.</p>
<p>I have many game design rules and laws that I would call “philosophies,” and one of them is that you should use small integers.</p>
<p>If your game assigns points to any one thing, you should establish the floor before you build the ceiling. If you apply points to any action in your game, you should never fail to outfit one of those actions with a value of Just One Point.</p>
<p>So I was designing a game, and filling it with small integers. All of this math was in the back-end, anyway: One thing was worth one “point,” and the second-best thing was worth two.</p>
<p>Now, some of you out there will tell me this is ridiculous, or naïve, and it is, sometimes. It’s usually for prototyping purposes. Usually, the Just One Point ends up being three or four points. Every once in a while, you get someone saying to make it five points, so that the numbers are a little easier to think about.<br>
Well, this particular anecdote doesn’t go there.<br>
Where it goes is this: The producer walks up and tells me, “Hey, the client and the IP holder were thinking we should multiply all the point values by a hundred, to make them ‘pop’.”</p>
<p>My gasp was so hard I could have inhaled a whiteboard. Fuck <em>you</em>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nintendo Power</span>.</p>
<p><b>XI</b><br>
The Final Thing I Learned isn’t so much of A Thing.</p>
<p>I worked, for a time, as a game designer at a Particularly Edgy And Famous Japanese Game Studio. Sometimes, the in-house PR person would be out attending to something important, and she’d email me from her smart phone. Usually, she only emailed me for one reason: to forward interview questions.</p>
<p>You see, a lot of games magazines all over the world wanted to interview the CEO of our company. He didn’t speak English, and they didn’t speak Japanese.</p>
<p>“They say they need the interview completed by tomorrow. Can you translate these questions into Japanese and send them back to me within an hour?”</p>
<p>The idea was, I’d translate the questions into Japanese and then send them to her. She would then send them to the CEO, who would, of course, think that she was a really fantastic and quick translator.</p>
<p>So I’d translate the questions into Japanese and send them to her. She’d send them to the CEO. He’d send them back to her, with his answers, and then she would send them to me, so I could translate the answers into English, before sending them back to PR, so she could look them over before sending them back to the magazine.</p>
<p>This happened a lot.</p>
<p>The interview questions were near-always written in a way that allowed the reader of the magazine to imagine that the interview had been conducted in person. The end of the interview would always say something like “Thanks for taking the time to answer our questions!” The CEO, ever the good sport, would play along, typing in something like, “It’s been my pleasure!”</p>
<p>Here, if I relaxed my eyes  a little bit, between the “It’s been my pleasure!” and the next sentence, I could make out the image of the CEO firing up Google, tabbing back over to his email, checking the nationality of the magazine, and then tabbing back over to Google.</p>
<p>“I wish the Brazilian national team luck in the big game against Finland!”<br>
“Germany’s chances look good for the World Cup!”<br>
“One of our employees is from Manchester, and he won’t stop talking about what a good soccer year they’re having!”<br>
“I’m rooting for Belgium in the game against Zaire tomorrow!”<br>
Et cetera.</p>
<p>If he didn’t have a soccer jersey representative of the country the magazine hailed from, he’d buy one. Either way, he’d get his secretary to photograph him in the jersey and a matching pair of pants. He’d attach the photo to the email, telling us to send it along to the editors.</p>
<p>By a matter of necessity, every interview contained a question about whether videogames are or were art. This was “a matter of necessity” because our CEO was the kind of person you’d ask about that. In the translated-from-French-or-German-to-English wording of the questions, I could sense the morbid, smoldering struggle of The Game Lover Who Took A Job. They always asked about one particular game, and, very often, about one part of that game: “Is [this one particular core element, wherein the player’s range of movement is restricted, in this one particular game] a commentary on how we can never be free, even in an escapist medium such as videogames?”</p>
<p>Very often, the all-Japanese file would come back to me with this question emboldened, and, beneath it, a hastily typed, unpunctuated reply:</p>
<p>“Delete this question. It’s numbered #6, so go through the rest of the questions and re-number them to make it look like this one never existed.”</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, that game was planned as a potential multi-million-selling blockbuster; what the writers perceived as art was, in fact, the creators’ unintentional failure.</p>
<p><b>XII</b><br>
I am a game design director; my years of writing and thinking about games served the purpose of getting me better acquainted with making them. I don’t want to sound like I am sending off and forever saying goodbye to the idea of my writing about games. I’m not. This is just me confessing that I’ve never really read anything anyone else has ever written about videogames. None of your opinions interest me. Mainstream reviews sites will give <em>God Hand</em> a 3.0 out of 10, and that’s <a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=645">one of the best games ever</a>. I’m not just talking about IGN.com when I say “none of your opinions”, either. Like, I’m real-life friends with Leigh Alexander, and I have never read more than two sentences of anything she’s ever written about videogames. I just don’t and can’t care what other people think about videogames, and it’s funny and cute — and simultaneously deadly serious — that other people care what I say. I am no one’s target audience. I am doomed to only ever be able to make my own decisions for myself.</p>
<p>The only opinions I care to read about videogames, to be 100% honest, are those of the people of <a href="http://forums.selectbutton.net">Select Button Dot Net</a>, a community made up of former readers of insert credit dot com, posters to its forums, or other people for whom this sort of tangential discussion is appealing. My enjoyment of that forum mostly stems from liking the way people who like videogames roughly the way I like videogames talk about . . . other stuff. So there’s that.</p>
<p>So Brandon and all my old bros say they want to start insert credit dot com back up again, because they just don’t see anything they feel like reading about games, and I agree — because I always have. So here I am, blogging about videogames, and here I am: By trying as hard as I can to not come off as a jerk, I come off as probably the biggest jerk in the universe. Here’s to many happy future accidents, many more seemingly pointless text-labyrinths, many more nightmares in cluttered garages. I’m mostly in on this because it means I get a reason to hang out and eat excellent pizza every other week with Brandon, Christian, Frank, Patrick, and Woodard. So ultimately, there’s my opinion about games-related writing and the idea of games being or not being important enough to deserve good prose: As long as it gives you a reason to be with people and things you like, say whatever you want.</p>
<p align="right"><i>-Tim Rogers is taking you seriously.</i></p>
<p><font color="black">Shorter answer: people should write about videogames if they enjoy videogames or writing, or even writing about videogames; they shouldn’t read things they don’t want to read, and if they can’t find things they don’t want to read, they should think about writing.</font> </p>
