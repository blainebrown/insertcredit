If you look over <a href="http://gamecareerguide.com/features/966/interview_toru_.php">here</a> you’ll find my interview with Pac-Man creator Iwatani, discussing his philosophy of game design, and why game creators shouldn’t be worrying about maximizing profit. </p>
<p>Nowadays, Iwatani is a video game professor at the Tokyo Polytechnic University, which he talks about a bit as well. In 2005, he posted a book called “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%91%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E5%AD%A6%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80-%E5%B2%A9%E8%B0%B7-%E5%BE%B9/dp/4757717520">Pac-Man’s Methods</a>” in Japanese only, but told me he hopes to get at least parts of it published in the West. </p>
<p>Though I suppose a lot of people have these now, I took a photo of some of the original character design work for Pac-Man, done with graph paper, which you can see to the left. If you like, you can <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014631/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PAC">watch his entire postmortem</a> of the original Pac-Man, a talk he gave at GDC 2011.</p>

<p><b>Brandon’s note:</b> To accompany your viewing, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdD2Spp26vs">here</a> is one of the only good Anthrax songs from that era, which you’ll note is actually written by Joe Jackson. I once saw guitarist Scott Ian in an airport, and couldn’t think of anything profound to say, so I just pointed at him and said: “SCOTT IAN.” He agreed.</p>

He was in the bay area for a little while, and I presumed he would be doing interviews with loads of people, so I talked to him for around 45 minutes in the Game Developer magazine office, then figured I should let him go to his next meeting, so as to not monopolize his time. Suzuki and his PR folks looked at each other and shrugged, saying “I guess we’ll get lunch!” Turns out mine was one of two appointments period, and I could’ve talked for as long as I wanted. Live and learn, I suppose. The results of the interview are <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6414/yu_suzuki_at_a_time_of_transition.php">here</a>, and looking back through it, there’s really so much more I could have and should have asked. </p>
<p>Getting him to warm up was interesting. In the middle of the interview, I had the random thought to ask him who he thought the best assembly-language programmers at Sega were, and this actually became a turning point, past which he was much more interested in speaking in general. In fact, he got so excited about programming that he decided to get out his laptop and show me several lines of code he had done for Shenmue Town in Visual Basic, which is his preferred language at the moment. Perhaps the best part of this code was a snippet at the top, which I will undoubtedly botch from memory. Here’s the gist of how it went:</p>
<p>FlightSim=False<br>
Battle=False<br>
Race=False<br>
FREE=True</p>
<p>You’ll note that he either pioneered or honed in 3D each of the genres mentioned. At the end of our meeting though, he shattered my expectations. After closing the code window, he moved over to a folder called “projects.” In there were no less than 10 work-in-progress ideas, about half of which were familiar Suzuki-led brands, appended with other words such as “shooter” or “experience.” The other half were entirely new projects. I won’t say what they were, because he asked me not to, but these aren’t just pie-in-the-sky ideas. He showed me videos of one game he wants to get funded, which had characters running around in a full world, and it was not the recently-semi-announced <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/34998/Yu_Suzuki_Signs_With_Premium_Agency_Working_On_Kinect_Fighter.php">Kinect fighting game</a>. Suzuki is definitely moving in a different direction with <a href="http://ysnet-inc.jp/">YS Net</a>, which I think will be a natural extension from, but quite different from his existing legacy.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.lzxindustries.net/bitvision">BitVision</a> is an audiovisual synthesis board that LZX Industries created a while back (when we weren’t posting, so this is okay!), in the tradition of Atari Video Music. If you’ve never seen Atari Video Music, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX1LVBLUYNs">here</a>‘s a nice man showing you what it’s all about.</p>
<p>The BitVision is intended for live performance, and simulates the color bleed and imperfection of a primitive 8-bit image on a CRT whilst displaying a 32×32 pixel image based on a 16 color palette, which is editable using the company’s provided tools. Many modulation capabilities are provided – as the company says, there is “<i>an analogue envelope follower and frequency counter track external audio signals and can modulate shape and color via many variable modulation routings. We wanted an audiovisualizer that could potentially provide live video for an entire musical performance, so 16 separate preset image/palette options are stored inside.</i>”</p>
<p>It comes in pre-assembled and kit versions, and continues on the long legacy of Atari visualizers, which has outlived the original Atari Video Music, and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrQOk7TseY">Virtual Light Machine</a> (VLM) on the Jaguar, to include Jeff Minter’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpmSA6pxCL4">audiovisual work</a> on the Xbox 360 (Neon). Below you can see the BitVision in action. Thanks to Jeff Fleming for the link.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> While the BitVision is sold out at the moment, I put in an email to creator Lars Larsen, who had this to say: “<i>We are building a batch of Bitvisions right now for Analogue Haven, which will ship sometime in the next month or two. We are small manufacturer so sometimes it can be hard to keep things in stock.</i>” So, simply play the waiting game, I suppose!</p>
