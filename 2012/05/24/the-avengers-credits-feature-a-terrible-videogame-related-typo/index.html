		<p>Hello, friends! </p>
<p>It’s official: I have seen “The Avengers” more than once. I will not say how <i>many</i> times more than once I have seen “The Avengers”, because that would shatter my reputation as someone who hates almost everything. </p>
<p>I come to you today as a news reporter: the film references the classic Namco arcade shooting game <i>Galaga</i> during one of those scenes where Tony “Robert Downey Jr.” Stark (aka “Iron Man”) delivers a tightly scripted virtuoso monologue displaying his smartness and intelligence. “That man over there is playing <i>Galaga</i>,” he says, interrupting himself. “He thought we didn’t notice. We did.” Then he interrupts his own interruption of himself, slashing right back to the stuff he was saying about gamma radiation and government conspiracies. He does this all while wearing a “Black Sabbath” T-shirt — one featuring <a href="http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/nintendo-copied-black-sabbath-for-the-triforce.173391950/">an image of the Triforce</a> from <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>. He’s wearing a Black Sabbath T-shirt because they’ve already used the AC/DC song “Shoot to Thrill” to introduce Iron Man’s heroic swoops into action twice across three films. Here is where, maybe, the producers at Marvel Studios made that same error that the BBC’s “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmIjisnTpYk">Look Around You</a>” once made, when they flat-out called AC/DC “Heavy Metal”. “Iron Man”‘s producers might have been going for a subtler pun, though the takeaway is this: AC/DC is not heavy metal. They are not metal at all. They are classic rock. If you call AC/DC “metal”, you also consider Frito-Lay a food group.</p>
<p>When Stark’s monologue is over (thirty seconds after the “Galaga” comment), we see a quick shot back into the bridge of the flying aircraft carrier where The Avengers hang out and argue for half the film. (It’s pleasant-enough arguing (I saw the film More Than Once, after all (it was research: I wanted a deeper understanding of a logistical particulars of a billion-dollar-earning film which genuinely uses dialogue as an attraction and not a boring thing that the writers couldn’t figure out how to get rid of).))</p>
<p>There he is: a man playing <i>Galaga</i>! Man! Why the heck did it have to be <i>Galaga</i>? Why not <i>Pac-Man</i>?</p>
<p><a href="/content/2012/05/nameco.jpg"><img src="/content/2012/05/nameco-1024x764.jpg" alt="" title="nameco" width="300" height="224" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5061" srcset="/content/2012/05/nameco-300x224.jpg 300w,/content/2012/05/nameco-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a> Well, if you watch the credits of “The Avengers” — and who wouldn’t, when movie studios these days have to promise <i>two</i> post-credits fun-nuggets at <i>least</i> just to keep up with the Joneses — you’ll see, after the seemingly endless part wherein you realize they employed Literally Every Special Effects Company Out There, a “special thanks” section that expresses gratitude for all the usuals (fire department, police department, et cetera), and then . . . “GALAGA [TM] & NAMECO BANDAI GAMES [Copyright symbol] courtesy NAMECO-BANDAI Games America Inc.”</p>
<p>So, there’s that: the person tasked with typing up the credits for “The Avengers” didn’t spell “Namco” correctly. This means <i>Galaga</i> is not adequately credited in the film. This means Namco can probably sue. Hey, Disney and Marvel Studios — just settle out of court. Offer them five hundred dollars — they’ll take it. That’s enough for them to make another <i>Tekken</i> game <b>EPIC BURN</b></p>
<p>Oh: you want to see photographic evidence? Just click that image up there, bloggers of the world. Sorry it’s a bit blurry; my hands were shaking vigorously with the thrill of <i>Hot Scoop Action</i>.</p>
<p>Man! Imagine how many <i>other</i> typos there are in the credits sequence of this movie! The real title is probably supposed to be “The Avengrs”. </p>
<p>Serious comment: that no one caught that typo is a little jarring, and kind of says a tiny little thing or two about how even the legendary Japanese game developer who made <i>Pac-Man</i> never quite became a Real Mainstream Household Name.</p>
