                                <a href="/content/2012/05/takoashi.jpg"><img src="/content/2012/05/takoashi.jpg" alt="" title="takoashi" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5058" srcset="/content/2012/05/takoashi.jpg 220w,/content/2012/05/takoashi-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" width="220" height="220"></a>John Cadice, creator of Tentacle Bento, says that while the game is full of sexy girls, and a “horrid, tentacle flailing, slime oozing monster from outer space,” his game is not about tentacle rape, but rather tentacle…tickling. And cake baking. Anything but rape.</p>
                            <p>Cadice says the game is a satire of a “horrid genre of anime,” but I simply don’t see the satire. It’s cuter, it’s lighter, but that does not a satire make. So I am meant to believe that while the game is based on the genre of tentacle rape anime, it is not <i>about</i> tentacle rape. There’s clearly a fundamental disconnect between our consideration of inference and implication versus intent.</p>
                            <p>I got an email from Cadice not two hours after my initial article, and within 24 hours the Kickstarter was canceled. We had a dialog all along the way, which was a very curious process. First Kickstarter limited the game’s searchability. The game was now only viewable through direct links. At the same time, my article, <a href="http://kotaku.com/5910304/come-on-a-card-game-about-tentacle-rape">as well as Kotaku’s</a>, had given the game greater media attention, and after my article went up the project rocketed up from $23,000 to $30,000 in funding. Clearly, as we scrutinized and criticized the project, we also popularized it. </p>
                            <p>After the project was canceled at Kickstarter, I wondered to myself – while I felt I had struck a blow against a game I found to trivialize rape and molestation, had I also struck a blow for censorship on Kickstarter? In the end, I feel this project shouldn’t have been allowed on the site in the first place – most of the approvals process at Kickstarter happens at the front end – it’s allowed, or not, based on what Kickstarter decides. I think this one simply fell through the cracks, and simply got canned much later than it should have. </p>
                            <p>I’ve been asked by some what part of the Kickstarter terms this game violates. It’s entirely subjective, but it’s <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/guidelines#">right here</a>: “Offensive material (hate speech, inappropriate content, etc).” There are some who don’t find this game offensive. Its creator claims the game is clearly not about rape or molestation. I maintain, based on looking at the Kickstarter itself, that it is, he just has a much higher threshold for it than I do. You could also make a case for it glorifying acts of violence, depending on which side of the “does this infer rape” argument you fall.</p>
                            <p>In the end though, I couldn’t stop the game from getting funded. The project had moved to its own site, and appears to be well on its way to coming out. I still maintain that the game is a trivialiation of rape and molestation, and that those supporting it are supporting that mindset. Cadice disagrees. In the following interview, Cadice speaks his mind about his project, and where he says it’s really coming from.

It’s called <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1189988320/tentacle-bento-by-soda-pop-miniatures">Tentacle Bento</a>, and it is currently overfunded on kickstarter by $10,000. Go on and watch the video. </p>
                            <p>This is a game about tentacle rape – you are meant to “get your slimy tendrils” on as many girls as possible within the given number of cards. But there are other tentacle monsters out to rape girls before you can! And dastardly school officials who can get in your way! Just choose some girls (sexy, sporty, smart, et cetera), a location, and a “sneaky snatch” to grab them with.</p>
                            <p>The style is a cute, lighthearted, pastel-colored look at the wonderful world of forcing your way inside a female against her will. There are, to my mind, a lot of things wrong with this.

(These are invariably the circles that don’t play much of either. When I hang out with my friends that do play either one, I’m usually The Guy Who Isn’t Very Good.)</p>
                            <p>“It’s so competitive when you play against another person.”</p>
                            <p>“It’s too hard.”</p>

                            <p>“There are just so many good players out there.”</p>
                            <p>I hear these things a lot. The person I am talking to–let’s call him Johnny Doughnuts–is making an excuse, even if he doesn’t realize it, for why he isn’t as good at <em>Starcraft 2</em> as I am. Why he chooses to spend his time doing something else. And really, I don’t care. Some people want to get good at Starcraft 2, others want to get good at skiing or whatever.</p>
                            <p>But I do find it interesting that Johnny Doughnuts describes <em>Starcraft 2</em> as an anomaly. As though it is practically the only thing challenging–in life, in video games, whatever.</p>

                            <p>He told me to go ahead — but conversation quickly turned to why I like the <em>Tales</em> series so much, when he’d never been able to get into it. We started to talk about it, but we both quickly realized I should write about it instead.</p>
                            <p>The in-your-face anime aesthetic of the series is what turned him off. This is comprehensible. It advertises what the series is about; it’s a stake firmly planted, and depending on where you’re at, it just as much says “not for me!” as it says “come on in!” to the people who like it.</p>
                            <p>I’ll start where I started: I like the series because of what it’s not. This all began for me in 1998, when I’d got fed up with the tedious, self-important <em>Xenogears</em> and, on a lark, followed it up with <em>Tales of Destiny</em>. I found it to be everything <em>Xenogears</em> wasn’t: cheerful, dopey, energetic, unassuming, entertaining, fun.</p>

                            <p>I played a lot of <em>Diablo II</em> back in the day.</p>
                            <p>I actually didn’t get that deep into vanilla <em>Diablo II</em>, though. Beat the game on normal with a Conversion/Thorns Paladin, found myself woefully underpowered for Nightmare, and put it down until Lord of Destruction came out. That’s when I got addicted. Six months later, I had four high-level Assassins of various builds, a magic find Sorceress, and a Lightning Fury Amazon specced specifically for Cow Level runs. Yes, I made a character whose sole purpose was to mow down cows with alarming efficiency.</p>
                            <p>One decade later, I would reflect with some of my friends on our shared addiction to <em>Diablo II</em>. “Man, that game was addictive,” we said. Pause. Then I said:</p>
                            <p>“But, you know, it wasn’t really that much fun.”</p>

While I have mixed feelings about being in an enclosed space (out of sight, out of mind), it’s true that people need to not be cold, and it could be an interesting place for discourse about homelessness, cooperatives, and everything the occupy movement is about. </p>
                            <p>It’s with that in mind that I direct you to <a href="https://www.wepay.com/donations/oak-u-tron-201x">this</a>. Anna Anthropy (aka Dessgeega from IC forums/Select Button) proposes adding an arcade machine to the new space, and will make a new game specifically for it. To do so, she needs funds. Unfortunately, the project was <a href="http://rpmcollective.com/2012/01/21/oak-u-tron-201x-banned-from-kickstarter,/">rejected from kickstarter</a>, and now has four days left to meet the goal of $2,000. If you felt like it, you could <a href="https://www.wepay.com/donations/oak-u-tron-201x">help make</a> an original occupy game happen in a rather interesting moment in a massive movement.</p>
                            <p>Here are some words from the project organizers that you can read: <i>“Every community center needs a game room to draw in the general public, to give people some respite and lighten spirits, and to give people an excuse to meet others in their community. And every good game room needs an arcade machine.</i></p>
                            <p>…if all goes will, the OAK-U-TRON 201X will be an official member part of the Winnitron Indie Game Arcade Network, showcasing the true, independent, DIY spirit of game developers around the globe!”</p>
