(Incidentally, it’s still <a href="http://www.caextreme.org/ticket_information">taking place tomorrow</a>, Sunday, in Santa Clara, CA, if any Bay Area folks feel like making an appearance!)</p>
<p>Although a lot of similar titles turn up year on year, CA Extreme is a gold mine in particular for early American arcade cabinets of the Atari and Midway ilk, from vector-based titles to limited-distribution prototypes. (The <a href="http://caextreme.org/games2011">game list</a> is semi-accurate, although there’s about 20% slosh in there of titles that didn’t make it, etc – since it’s all volunteer based.)</p>
<p>Some of the rarer titles on play have really got me thinking about the interesting experiments of the early arcade period — and what we can learn from them from a design perspective. So, here are the less obvious titles I played today that really spoke to me, and just why:</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9648">Space Dungeon</a> (Taito, 1981 – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQisVkzKiHw">YouTube video</a>)<br>
Apparently created before Eugene Jarvis’ seminal Robotron 2084, this is a frantic, Rex Battenberg-designed dual-stick shooter. And it’s a blast, once you work out which are the enemies and which are the pickups in the game (seriously, not that obvious!) There’s an interesting game design counterplay in going out of the way to grab pickups versus heading straight for the exit. Frenetic and unexpected.</p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8601">Major Havoc</a> (Atari, 1983 – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9UEuciaoM0">YouTube video</a>)<br>
One of a pair of absolutely mindblowing – and somewhat lesser-known – Atari titles from the prodigously talented Owen Rubin. Major Havoc is consecutively an interesting-angled Galaga style title, a swift Lunar Lander-style mini-game and a physics-heavy platformer, all using super-attractive vector graphics. Design lessons? Multiple genres in one game can really work, spinner-controlled physics is fun _and_ frustrating. And the main character has an idle animation!</p>

I had a couple of goals with this game. The first is that I had been researching <a href="http://www.aderack.com/game-maker/index.php?title=Main_Page">RSD Game-Maker</a>, a 20-year-old DOS-based development environment (see my <a href="/2011/06/30/from-shooter-to-shooter-the-rise-of-cly5m/">earlier post</a> about cly5m), and I wondered if the old tools would support a relevant, contemporary game. As it turns out — maybe!</p>
<p>My other goal ties into the weirdness of the old engine. I have long been fascinated with glitches, and the odd mechanical and expressive qualities that they bring to a game. I figured this was a chance for me to  explore the deliberate aspects of both of those qualities. You can play the surface game, and it’s fine — but until you start to pick away at the scenery, you’re only getting a part of the picture.</p>
<p>I won’t say that <em>Builder </em>is the most profound or involving game on the planet, but I’m pleased with it.  You can <a href="http://www.aderack.com/builder/">download it</a> for PC or Mac (which I have not tested; I have been told is a little slow), and you can make it work in Linux. There are more screenshots <a href="http://www.aderack.com/builder/screens.php">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZuQeDT3Sqo">here</a>‘s a play-through by Ken Taylor of the webcomic <a href="http://tsuduku.moosheep.org/">(tsuduku…)</a>. I suggest, if you plan on finishing the game, that you not watch past the first video.</p>

<p>I aimed to answer this question as I set out from the fortified comfort of my mixed use urban dwelling and took to the wide open interstate tarmac like an eagle to the wind. Just as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_riders">Freedom Riders</a> who came fifty years before me, my journey is one of great peril and even greater faith. I’m headed straight for the Bay Area’s deep south, the true heartland of Olde Silicon Valley. This is not the friendly faced home of Apple, Google, or other such enlightened tech companies that sit on civilized soil mere miles to the north. Rather, this is the rough and ready turf of San Jose, CA, the Bay Area’s final frontier. What could possibly bring me to this desolate and hostile outpost of an economy languishing in obsolescence? The former offices of SNK Corporation of America.</p>

Even if you’ve never played it, you’ve played <a href="http://nifflas.ni2.se/?page=Knytt">something influenced</a> by cly5m’s game. <em>Seiklus</em> was one of the first “exploration platformers,” a nonviolent genre that could be compared to a side-scrolling <em>Myst</em>, and now a distinct piece of the indie style guide. A small man, nearly a stick figure, travels a flat-colored world, collecting pointless trinkets and the occasional control upgrade, to find his way back home again. There is no death, and no aggression; Seiklus is all about the journey, and the player’s relationship with the game world.</p>
<p>Seiklus comes off as a very personal game. Although the controls amount to little more than walking and jumping, and the presentation is nearly as minimalist, the experience feels emotionally rich. Its level geometry and sequencing trade epiphanies for careful observation and experimentation, and the sound design creates a distinct and whimsical atmosphere. </p>
<p><a href="/content/2011/06/seiklus_promo03_320.png"><img src="/content/2011/06/seiklus_promo03_320.png" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4710" srcset="/content/2011/06/seiklus_promo03_320.png 479w,/content/2011/06/seiklus_promo03_320-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>The stripped-down expression of <em>Seiklus </em>has helped to legitimize canned game creation systems, leading Mark Overmars’ Game Maker to become the respected behemoth it is now, and lending the indie scene an entry-level spine. There have been <a href="http://gamejolt.com/freeware/games/adventure/sulkeis/2812/">tributes and parodies</a>. It’s just an important game.</p>
<p>For all its influence, <em>Seiklus</em> is kind of a one-off. For a while cly5m and Robert Lupinek teased the Internet with <em>Velella</em>, a sort of spiritual successor involving dream flight. Otherwise, the last eight years have passed <a href="http://www.autofish.net/video_games/creation/game_maker/gmprojects.html">pretty quietly</a>. The previous eight, though – that’s a different story.<br><a href="/2011/06/30/from-shooter-to-shooter-the-rise-of-cly5m/#more-4703" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading From Shooter to Shooter: The Rise of cly5m">(more…)</span></a></p>

<p>For those who haven’t played the game, it’s about an armed rebellion of fruits and vegetables taking on a twisted dictator that is selling them out to farmers for reasons that are never made entirely clear.</p>
<p>It’s got some great self-referential humor, jaunty music, and some of the most memorable characters in the NES library. Characters so memorable that you just kind of want to cut them up and eat them, which is what we’re going to do.</p>

They used to have a feature called “videogame inventions we don’t need,” which is an odd concept to begin with, but this illustration is simply horrifying. Or arousing? It depends on who you are and what you’re into, I suppose. </p>
<p>Either, way I wouldn’t want to be in the middle of this joystick human centipede. The image was put to paper by underground comic artist and <a href="http://www.dimensionsmagazine.com/images/exhibits/sonntag/">lover of fat women</a> (not safe for work) Ned Sonntag.</p>
<p>Check out the larger version for maximum horror. Really, just look at the face of the fellow on top. Enjoy…if you dare!</p>

<p>Several days ago, Jeffrey Matulef discussed this mechanic <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35311/Analysis_Weakening_Heroes_And_The_Pursuit_Of_Progress.php">on Gamasutra</a>, to decent effect (mild spoiler alert in there, by the way). </p>
<p>More interesting than the article itself perhaps, is a reply by Craig Adams, aka Superbrothers, which I reprint below. Do be aware that there are absolutely some spoilers in here, so if you’ve not finished the game, you may not want to read through to the full page. Otherwise, look on:</p>
<p><i>“Super glad you dug our decisions re: The Scythian’s deteriorating condition in Sword & Sworcery.</i></p>
<p>S:S&S EP isn’t a mechanics-focused videogame, it’s closer to an audiovisual storybook… and as you point out in your article (with the Indiana Jones reference), dramatic stories in film or in books often end up with a broken & battered protagonist limping to the finish line… I would say this is a normal flow of an adventure story, and it’s only videogame stories that choose to do the inverse.</p>

It was at a very early stage, with only two characters in – the current build, which was shown at E3, now has three. </p>
<p>A couple of my friends from the beloved <a href="http://visublog.mechafetus.com/">Mechafetus Visublog</a> work there, and so I had occasion to visit their workspace, and poke around a little bit. I was particularly impressed by the chaotic whiteboard, which I understand they’ve been taking pictures of as it evolves, and may reveal those at the end of the project for interested fans. In the interim though, you can browse the photo to the left. It’s essentially an infodump from the artists’ brains. <a href="/content/2011/06/IMG_20110216_191409.jpg">Here</a>, you’ll find a detail of the little sort-of-comic-fragment in the middle. <b>Update!</b> Reverge has already started doing <a href="http://revergelabs.com/2011/06/whiteboard-wednesday-2000/">Whiteboard Wednesdays</a>, showcasing the art in greater detail, including <a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5275/5862256612_92a3aaf64c_b.jpg">this</a> awesome SNK section, with Athena and Ikari Warriors. It is amusing! The whiteboard I’ve linked to this post was only shown in part for the first installment of the series, so most of it hasn’t been seen before.</p>
<p>Skullgirls is coming “some time in 2011,” and our very own Vincent Diamante is the audio director now, Castlevania’s Michiru Yamane is composing, and Alex Ahad, Mariel Cartwright, Jonathan Kim, and Ouendan are doing art and animation, so at the very least, it’ll look and sound pretty neat when it comes out!</p>
