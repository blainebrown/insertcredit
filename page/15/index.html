<p>As <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/30152/Sense_of_Wonder_Night_2010s_Featured_Indie_Games_Revealed.php">a Gamasutra story</a> about last year’s SoWN (which I sadly missed!) explains, the showcase is to <em>“discover  new and unconventional game concepts that “catch people by surprise and  give them a Sense of Wonder — a sense that something will change in  their world — right at the instant of seeing or hearing the concept.'”</em></p>
<p>There are up to ten Japanese, Asian and Western games showcased yearly. Previous notable Western games that have also been Sense Of Wonder Night exhibitors —  with onstage presentations simultaneously translated to Japanese and English — include <em>Shadow Physics, PixelJunk Eden, The Misadventures Of P.B. Winterbottom,</em> and <em>Moon Stories</em>.<br><a href="/2011/06/25/got-a-sense-of-wonder/#more-4693" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Got A Sense Of Wonder?">(more…)</span></a></p>

If you look over <a href="http://gamecareerguide.com/features/966/interview_toru_.php">here</a> you’ll find my interview with Pac-Man creator Iwatani, discussing his philosophy of game design, and why game creators shouldn’t be worrying about maximizing profit. </p>
<p>Nowadays, Iwatani is a video game professor at the Tokyo Polytechnic University, which he talks about a bit as well. In 2005, he posted a book called “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%91%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E5%AD%A6%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80-%E5%B2%A9%E8%B0%B7-%E5%BE%B9/dp/4757717520">Pac-Man’s Methods</a>” in Japanese only, but told me he hopes to get at least parts of it published in the West. </p>
<p>Though I suppose a lot of people have these now, I took a photo of some of the original character design work for Pac-Man, done with graph paper, which you can see to the left. If you like, you can <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014631/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PAC">watch his entire postmortem</a> of the original Pac-Man, a talk he gave at GDC 2011.</p>

He was in the bay area for a little while, and I presumed he would be doing interviews with loads of people, so I talked to him for around 45 minutes in the Game Developer magazine office, then figured I should let him go to his next meeting, so as to not monopolize his time. Suzuki and his PR folks looked at each other and shrugged, saying “I guess we’ll get lunch!” Turns out mine was one of two appointments period, and I could’ve talked for as long as I wanted. Live and learn, I suppose. The results of the interview are <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6414/yu_suzuki_at_a_time_of_transition.php">here</a>, and looking back through it, there’s really so much more I could have and should have asked. </p>
<p>Getting him to warm up was interesting. In the middle of the interview, I had the random thought to ask him who he thought the best assembly-language programmers at Sega were, and this actually became a turning point, past which he was much more interested in speaking in general. In fact, he got so excited about programming that he decided to get out his laptop and show me several lines of code he had done for Shenmue Town in Visual Basic, which is his preferred language at the moment. Perhaps the best part of this code was a snippet at the top, which I will undoubtedly botch from memory. Here’s the gist of how it went:</p>
<p>FlightSim=False<br>
Battle=False<br>
Race=False<br>
FREE=True</p>
<p>You’ll note that he either pioneered or honed in 3D each of the genres mentioned. At the end of our meeting though, he shattered my expectations. After closing the code window, he moved over to a folder called “projects.” In there were no less than 10 work-in-progress ideas, about half of which were familiar Suzuki-led brands, appended with other words such as “shooter” or “experience.” The other half were entirely new projects. I won’t say what they were, because he asked me not to, but these aren’t just pie-in-the-sky ideas. He showed me videos of one game he wants to get funded, which had characters running around in a full world, and it was not the recently-semi-announced <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/34998/Yu_Suzuki_Signs_With_Premium_Agency_Working_On_Kinect_Fighter.php">Kinect fighting game</a>. Suzuki is definitely moving in a different direction with <a href="http://ysnet-inc.jp/">YS Net</a>, which I think will be a natural extension from, but quite different from his existing legacy.</p>

If you’ve never seen Atari Video Music, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX1LVBLUYNs">here</a>‘s a nice man showing you what it’s all about.</p>
<p>The BitVision is intended for live performance, and simulates the color bleed and imperfection of a primitive 8-bit image on a CRT whilst displaying a 32×32 pixel image based on a 16 color palette, which is editable using the company’s provided tools. Many modulation capabilities are provided – as the company says, there is “<i>an analogue envelope follower and frequency counter track external audio signals and can modulate shape and color via many variable modulation routings. We wanted an audiovisualizer that could potentially provide live video for an entire musical performance, so 16 separate preset image/palette options are stored inside.</i>”</p>
<p>It comes in pre-assembled and kit versions, and continues on the long legacy of Atari visualizers, which has outlived the original Atari Video Music, and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrQOk7TseY">Virtual Light Machine</a> (VLM) on the Jaguar, to include Jeff Minter’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpmSA6pxCL4">audiovisual work</a> on the Xbox 360 (Neon). Below you can see the BitVision in action. Thanks to Jeff Fleming for the link.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> While the BitVision is sold out at the moment, I put in an email to creator Lars Larsen, who had this to say: “<i>We are building a batch of Bitvisions right now for Analogue Haven, which will ship sometime in the next month or two. We are small manufacturer so sometimes it can be hard to keep things in stock.</i>” So, simply play the waiting game, I suppose!</p>

<p>These are, as far as I know, the very first screenshots ever taken of the original Sonic the Hedgehog, from Sega’s display at the Tokyo Toy Show, June 7, 1990. The game was about two months into its fourteen-month development cycle, so there probably wasn’t very much there yet. </p>
<p>I scanned these from old issues of EGM (#s 13 and 16, for those playing along at home), so God only knows if EGM actually took these or if they stole them from a Japanese magazine. If anyone has a collection of Japanese mags from that era, take a look and let us know if there are any others.</p>
<p>The preview that accompanied these was pretty vague (“In Sonic Hedgehog, you control a super rodent on a mission to defeat the evil creatures that have populated your home.”), so I don’t know if the game was actually playable or if it was just a video feed or something. Regardless, it’s neat to see such an iconic game in such an early, embryonic state.</p>

<p>Sonic the Hedgehog turns 20 years old today. Isn’t that great? It’s also my dad’s 61st birthday, so that’s cool, too. Like my dad, Sonic the Hedgehog’s birthday occasionally falls on Father’s Day. This makes Sonic about as much of a father to you as my father is also a father to all of you guys.</p>
<p>To celebrate Sonic’s birthday, <a href="http://kotaku.com/5814830/happy-birthday-sonic-the-hedgehog-heres-how-not-to-suck">I did a Kotaku</a>. Forgive me! They offered money! The idea of the piece is that it’s “eight ways to fix Sonic the Hedgehog”, written for the target audience of a Sega who seems intent on doing the exact opposite of what people want. So I am reverse-psychologizing their reverse-psychology. It’s kind of stupid!</p>
<p>Though it has some fun sentences, maybe, like where I say chubbier, lighter-blue, black-eyed 1991 Sonic meeting darker-blue, longer-armed, green-eyed Sonic is “not as exciting as Superman meeting Batman — it’s more like ‘X-Men The Movie’ Wolverine meeting ‘X-Men Origins: Wolverine’ Wolverine.”</p>
<p>A more sincere, heartfelt “how to fix Sonic” article is perhaps this <a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=396"><em>Outrun 2</em> review from 2008</a>, in which I call <em>Outrun 2</em> the “16th best game of all-time”, and also “the best Sonic the Hedgehog game of all-time”, and I swear I am not <em>trying</em> to troll or be a jerk about that. It’s something I actually believe.</p>
<p>insertcredit.com exclusive: In commemoration of Sonic the Hedgehog’s 20th birthday, I made a Youtube playlist (below) of some of my favorite Dreams Come True songs. The bassist of Dreams Come True, Masato Nakamura, composed the (excellent) soundtrack for <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>, which is just a big, beautiful, boisterous, exuberant videogame full of confident graphical design. It’s probably the best <strong>actual</strong> <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> game — as far as I know, Brandon thinks so, too. (<em>Brandon’s note: As much as I like Sonic CD and its music, I agree with this statement.</em>)</p>

<p>This one is called Star Odyssey and, unlike the last two, it is Japanese-style RPG that is actually from Japan: both Beggar Prince and Legend of Wukong came from Taiwan. For those who like overclassifying things, that makes it a JJRPG as opposed to a TJRPG.</p>
<p>The game <em>was</em> released in Japan by the publisher with one of my favorite names ever, Hot B. It was called Blue Almanac over there, which totally strikes me as one of those Japanese game titles that was chosen because it was two cool-sounding English words that don’t actually mean anything together.</p>
<p>Blue Almanac doesn’t seem particularly well-remembered; I can’t find any videos on Nico, and YouTube just has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4L9wkvW7UY">one music track</a> and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luHa96MF_vM">super hilarious “review”</a> from an internet superstar who says “fuck” a lot.</p>
<p>There was going to be an official translation done at one point, and a build of it by American publisher Sage’s Creation (an early licensee that published Hot B games in America) <a href="http://forums.lostlevels.org/viewtopic.php?p=21527">was found</a> by <a href="http://www.hidden-palace.org/">this guy</a>.</p>
<p>“Gonna release this in a few days, when I get some stuff sorted out,” he wrote on March 1, 2008, before <em>never speaking of it again</em>. As it turns out, Super Fighter worked out a deal with him to acquire the ROM and officially license the game through its rights holder. Apparently that official English version wasn’t fit to release, though, with Super Fighter’s hired programmer saying that “the entire script was nothing but Engrish trash.”</p>
<p>“The game crashed after several hours; there were sprites walking around that you couldn’t speak to; the entire game was written using a hideous font; descriptions for most of the items and magic types made no sense,” he said.</p>
<p>The entire game was <a href="http://www.starodysseygame.com/history.htm">fixed up</a> over the last couple years, with a lot of weird bugs and useless features removed (they even balanced the difficulty!).</p>
<p>I haven’t played the game yet, but it looks like a Phantasy Star II knockoff. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing! If this sounds like a thing you might enjoy purchasing, you can do that <a href="http://www.starodysseygame.com/purchase.htm">here</a> for $40 plus shipping. You should also buy <a href="http://www.zaku-lynx.com/">Zaku</a> while you’re there because it’s a Lynx game about a fox that shoots other animals to get back some stolen game development middleware. How can you not want that?</p>

In HG’s case, he camped it up about being pretend-gay, and had a catch phrase or two as a ridiculous character in the Japanese pro wrestling scene. He was quite popular for some time, as homophobia is still all the rage in japan, but he shattered his foot in 2009, which ended his pro wrestling career. He hoped to continue his “comedy” act unabated.</p>
<p>Valhalla, you’ll remember, is expert girl-toucher Tomonobu Itagaki’s new game studio, after leaving Tecmo and taking a bunch of the top brass with him. The company announced Devil’s Third some time ago, but gave it a “proper” unveiling at this E3. For this unveling, THQ Japan decided to hire HG to go to the studio and be a fake jerk to everyone.  </p>
<p>The announcement video seen at the show was just a few minutes long, but the entire ordeal was some 17 minutes plus, which has been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yldYBZa1ZwY">archived</a> on youtube for all to enjoy. It’s subtitled, as well. If you like looking at white people in Japanese game studios, this is the video for you!</p>

<p>One would presume this video was rather expensive, but given HG is pretty much just <a href="http://zepy.momotato.com/2009/04/07/doujin-eroge-were-being-introduced-on-tv/">announcing adult video programs</a> on late-night TV now, maybe not so much. I will admit that I do approve of the line… “I’m a celebrity…well in 2005 I was… anyway!!!”</p>

The site was created in 2001, launched on april 8 2002, and went on hiatus round about june 2009. </p>
<p>This resurrection has been a long time in the making, and I think we’ve got a group of people now who really want to do this. I make no guarantees, but I am hopeful that we’ll stick around for a little while. Don’t expect constant, or even daily updates. Don’t expect us to cover things that everyone else is covering. The old days of being an import game site are mostly over, and <a href="http://www.siliconera.com/">others</a> are covering the news <a href="http://www.andriasang.com/e/">better</a> than us anyway. </p>
<p>So then, why are we back? A lot of that is said in our <a href="/2011/06/20/journalism-the-videogame-redux/">quasi-manifesto</a> below, but to sum up, the game-related website we wanted to read didn’t exist anymore… and it was because we weren’t making it. The solution was deviously obvious! We are making this site for us, and for people like us. Time was, that was a lot of people. We’ll see how it is now!</p>
