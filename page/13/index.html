Here you’ll see inside Taito USA’s factory (the president is about the biggest sleaze I’ve seen caught on tape from that era), hear about “pac-man wrist,” and get some wise words about games and kids from an unusually sensible psychologist. That man deserves an award. And at the 2:30 mark, is “Burt Price” actually Will Wright with a beard? Sure looks and sounds like it! The whole thing is worth a look though, if you like your history.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best bit of this video is the revelation of an unreleased Taito USA arcade game called Toasters and Chainsaws, which was reportedly being made by “Rex and Mark.” Frank Cifaldi deduced that Rex is Rex Battenberg, and through him, I learned that Mark is Mark Blaszczyk. Unfortunately, Rex is the only guy I can get ahold of so far, and he doesn’t remember the game at all. I’ll be following these leads until I root out the truth, so stay tuned!</p>

So much so, that companies will still sometimes just hire anyone off the street. </p>
<p>3-year Sega veteran Mac Senour (1990-1993) has a number of interesting anecdotes on his <a href="http://aboutmakinggames.blogspot.com/">blog</a> about getting into the industry. One of the more interesting ones is about <a href="http://aboutmakinggames.blogspot.com/2009/10/who-really-says-your-product-is-done.html">valuing your QA staff</a>. In the article, he mentions that Sega had a particularly cavalier attitude toward quality assurance. Here’s an excerpt:</p>
<p><i>While I was helping them connect multiplayer,  I had the following exchange with one of them:</i></p>
<p>Me:  “Like boxing games?”</p>
<p>Tester: “Si.”</p>
<p>Me: “Every play any boxing games before?”</p>
<p>Tester: “No.”</p>
<p>Me:  “What were you doing yesterday?”</p>
<p>He turned to another tester and said a few words in Spanish and then did a pantomime that resembled digging, and said: “Ditch.”</p>
<p>Yes, they had hired ditch diggers to test games.</p>
<p>If anyone has the credits handy, please send me the valiant diggers’ names! And if so many ditch diggers were working on Sega games, it could explain why the roads have gotten so bad around here…</p>

Crazy though it may seem, IBM has done it at long last. The company has created a series of 3-mm wide <a href="http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4218883/IBM-demos-cognitive-computer-chips">cognitive computer chips</a>, the components of which are designed to emulate neurons and synapses even more than previous computer chips were meant to emulate neurons and synapses. And the proof is in the grey matter pudding, as $20 million in research later, IBM has achieved intelligent Pong AI, that holy grail of computing for lo these past 40 years.</p>
<p>As EE Times reports: <i>IBM envisions its cognitive computers solving a wide variety of applications in navigation, machine vision, pattern recognition, associative memory and classification. So far it has taught one to recognize a cursive letter “7” regardless of in whose handwriting. The other has learned to play (and win against humans) at the game “Pong.”</i></p>
<p>Success! And IBM is getting a new round of funding from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) to the tune of $21 million, presumably to enable the chips to learn to play (and win) at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg93nPgR6rw">Windjammers</a>.</p>
<p><b>Update!</b> Years ago, IBM created a freeware Pong clone, and released it on the internet. Was it training us to become better at Pong so that its computers could later best us!? Were we the unwitting beta testers? Has this been in the works since 2006-ish!? Any other conclusion is impossible! Play it after the jump! (because otherwise it would autoload and make annoying sounds)<br><a href="/2011/08/18/ibms-20-million-pong-ai/#more-4923" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading IBM’s $20 million Pong AI">(more…)</span></a></p>

So it was that Halo 2600 was born – a top-down, multi-screen shooter with a high degree of sophistication for the console.</p>
<p>For those interested in taking a similar path, Fries has taken the next step. “I thought I’d celebrate the one year anniversary of the release of Halo 2600 at the Classic Gaming Expo by making the source code available,” said Fries in an AtariAge forum post. “It’s not particularly cleaned up or well documented but I put it here, as is, with the hopes that it will help some future 2600 homebrew programmers, just as I was helped by others who posted their code.”</p>

The write up was quite fine, but everyone moved on shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>It was one year later (March 8, 2008 to be precise) that a fellow named Craig George found the article. He decided that, finally, he had discovered the perfect venue for his master work – a continuation of The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess. His game would be called “Zelda Master of Legend,” and would be the <i>greatest Zelda game of all time.</i></p>
<p>For five months, from March 8 through August 2, Craig George <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=13103">went on to post</a> some 190+ comments, amounting to nearly 40,000 words (give or take, there are a few anonymous posts that may not be him), unleashing his opus upon the unsuspecting populace – especially unsuspecting, since this was embedded in a year-old gamasutra news article that very few persons would come across. And few persons did. Aside from the aformention possible anonymous posts not by Craig, he made this journey alone.</p>
<p>Craig, or Craigie (or Mindy, or Link, or Zelda, or Joshua, and so on), is not your average fanfic author. Whereas at the beginning, on March 8 2008, he seems a delusional but harmless fanatic, over the course of the five months chronicled here, he descends rapidly into what appears a type of madness, which waxes and wanes as each day progresses.<br><a href="/2011/07/25/the-madness-of-craig-george/#more-4694" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading The madness of Craig George">(more…)</span></a></p>

<p>Glamorous as it may seem, the life of a game journalist is not always pleasurable. Among the many tradeshows and events we grudgingly attend, there are few more distasteful than the human catastrophe descending upon Southern California this July 21-24: the San Diego Comic Con. As my colleagues and contemporaries will testify safely under their breath, <em>SDCC </em>is the most unfortunate of all industry gatherings. This is because it combines two wholly countervailing elements: the industry and the masses. Unlike the fortified sanctum of E3 with its lavishly erected accoutrements and ample supply of complimentary alcohol, <em>SDCC</em> is a veritable feedlot for the most rabid breed of consumer livestock. How videogames became assimilated into this corporate merchandising unicomplex, one dare not consider. Indeed, resistance is futile: receiving the assignment to cover <em>SDCC</em> is akin to plummeting into the tarry abyss of journalism’s Rankor pit. Sampling the event’s many festivities – standing in various sorts of lines, mostly – is enough to break even the most hardened tradeshow survivor. This is precisely why the corporate afterparty, with its sub-Lunchables-quality hors d’oeuvres upon which we games journalists subsist, was created. But such oases of sanity are absent here, lest they be overrun by our arch nemesis: John Q. Public and his insatiable appetite for all manner of consumption. He is not alone. Jane Q. Public will make her presence known just as loudly, usually by way of a spandex superheroine costume displaying equal parts <a href="http://www.comicbookhotties.com/cosplayers/comic-con/pictures/?i=6935" target="_blank">cleavage</a> and <a href="http://www.comicbookhotties.com/cosplayers/comic-con/pictures/?i=6944" target="_blank">emotional problems</a>. What is there for a serious professional to do here? If all else fails, he can purchase myriad limited edition action figures with which to clutter his office cubicle in some quaint attempt at self-expression. But never before has an actual games journalist been immortalized in hardened petroleum byproduct. Until now. Not to toot my own horn, but beep-beep.</p>

<p><em>Fable fumbles toward excellence. There has rarely been such an obvious and concrete example of a genre’s awkward adolescence. It takes concepts other games have explored, serves them up in a new light, and hopes to be noticed and loved despite its spots and cracking voice. Fable is not a bold evolution of the genre so much as a necessary growth spurt.</em></p>
<p>I was the first person in the world who was permitted to review <em>Fable</em>. This is the final paragraph of the <em>Fable</em> review I wrote in 2004.</p>
<p>Some things never change: <em>Fable </em>is still very, very awkward.</p>
<p>In fact, right now, we’re in the most awkward part of the the <em>Fable</em> cycle — where the prior entry in the series has left us with <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6415/peter_molyneux_on_building_the_.php">disappointing memories</a> (“The real dream… The feeling that you’re going through the game at your own pace, but having to make these tough choices, was never actually realized”) and the newest entry is represented only by <a href="http://gamasutra.com/view/news/35552/Gamelab_2011_Molyneux_Addresses_Concerns_About_Fable_The_Journey.php">fulsome promises</a> (“[The addition of a horse to <em>Fable 4</em>] is going to have so much feeling for you. Just taking care of him, grooming him, and healing him, he’s going to be like nothing you’ve seen in games before.”)</p>
<p>With that in mind, it’s easy to forget that at one point, <em>Fable</em> seemed like it quite possibly might be the future of RPGs. This is something I believed in 2004.</p>
