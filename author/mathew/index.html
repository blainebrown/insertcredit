<p>Brendon also let slip that they <i>might</i> be working on a Metalocalypse video game, too, so keep your eyes open for that.</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s not any good at all, but it’s an interesting curio, and at least you get to listen to the Mastodon song Colony of Birchmen on repeat while you bore yourself stupid playing it. (I haven’t checked with Brandon, our resident overlord of what is hip, if it’s okay to like Mastodon, but I think it’s a good single, anyway.)

		<p><img alt="2006_11_30_miuchiz.jpg" src="http://www.insertcredit.com/archives/2006_11_30_miuchiz.jpg" width="200" height="136" border="0" align="left" hspace="5">As a freelance journalist I tend to spend rather a lot of my time lazily flicking through the television channels in the middle of the day when I should be working, and more often than not I find myself distracted by the adverts for the toys currently vying to be placed on children’s Christmas wish lists, in particular the ones that are videogames, but do their best to pretend they’re not (by saying they’re “educational” or “for all the family” or something.) Just off the top of my head there are things like the <a href="http://zapitgames.com/gameWave.htm">Game Wave</a> “Family Entertainment System”, and the ridiculous range of educational techo-mcguffins from Fisher Price, such as the <a href="http://www.fisher-price.com/fp.aspx?st=2280&e=hasflash&z=1&pcat=pixacc&pid=34140">Pixter</a> handheld system, or the <a href="http://www.fisher-price.com/us/products/product.asp?id=35911">I Can Play Piano</a> (which brings to mind the Miracle Piano system released for the NES.)</p>
<p>Recently though I’ve been most captivated by the advertising for the <a href="http://www.miuchiz.com/">Miuchiz</a> handheld system, which, while little more than a Tamagochi-esque trinket, when connected to a PC with the included USB cable, appears to allow the user to take their character into a fully 3D MMORPG, Planet Mion, where they can interact with other users, play games, and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Is it any good? I have no idea. It’s for kids!</p>
<p><img alt="gamewave.jpg" src="http://www.insertcredit.com/archives/news/112006/gamewave.jpg" width="200" height="119" hspace="5" align="right"><br><i>Brandon’s note about Game Wave:</i> I had meant to do a proper post about this, but mathew’s gotten the ball rolling already. All I really wanted to say was that it’s clearly the game system made “by Canadians, for Canadians,” as the parent company <a href="http://www.zapitgames.com/%22">Zapit Games</a> is located in the great white north (Mississauga). That particular system is also a DVD player, and comes with four ‘zappers,’ aka remotes, which allow you to interact with the screen in (maybe?) a Wii-like manner. Or perhaps you just choose up, down, left, and right, and it’s really *only* a DVD player that they’ve inexplicably tried to pass off as something else. If that’s the case, there’s a good chance their games will work on anything that plays the format. The only proper game-like game they’ve got is bejeweled, but I’m always entranced by these half-effort style things.</p>
<p><i>Mathew’s note about Brandon’s note:</i> As far as I’ve seen from the adverts, there is no “Wii” like functionality; not to say that the games don’t have specifics that mean they could only be played on a Game Wave. What the <i>adverts</i> have is a jingle that promises quiz games and rhymes “big words” with “little nerds”, and is performed by the kind of session musicians that cry themselves to sleep every night.</p>
<p><i>Brandon’s newest of notes:</i> I found that <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=vQbpK8-CQmw&mode=related&search=">commercial</a>, and it’s as astounding as he says it is. Check the youtube comments too, as they’re clearly written by people who are, let’s say, “concerned” about the success of the Game Wave.</p>

Well, they’re an astonishingly prolific pair of British siblings who’ve been in the industry since the days of 8-bit computers, and most recently have created <a href="http://www.zee-3.com/nakedwar/index.php">Naked War</a>, a rather lovely play-by-email game which is a lot more exciting than “play-by-email” makes it sound (though perhaps not as exciting as “naked” makes it sound) and that you should all check out if you have the time. </p>
<p>But what has piqued our interest most recently is that on their personal website, <a href="http://www.zee-3.com/index.php">Zee-3</a>, they’re just uploaded a rather <a href="http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/archive/zub.php">in-depth article</a> about the creation of the first title they worked on as a team, the ZX Spectrum title Zub, which is very informative for anyone interested in what went into making a game on home computers in the 80’s. They’ve also got <a href="http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/archive/plok.php">an article</a> on the creation of Plok, for people who remember the 1993 SNES title with fondness.</p>
<p><i>EJRW comment:</i> Did you know the Pickford Brothers are actually behind some of Rare’s more interesting NES games, like Solar Jetman and Ironsword? Well, neither did I before I did <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/aug2006/id20060830_275338.htm?chan=innovation_game+room_interviews">some research</a> a while ago. Now we all know!</p>

Well, recently CMP had the audacity to publish (on their <a href="http://www.gamecareerguide.com">Game Career Guide</a> website) an article called <a href="http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/295/so_you_want_to_be_a_games_.php">“So You Want to Be a Games Journalist”</a> written by one Aaron McKenna, that managed to rile up games journalists <a href="http://www.kierongillen.com">Kieron Gillen</a>  and <a href="http://pcgtim.wordpress.com/">Tim Edwards</a> so much that they arranged for as many games journalists as they could think of to publish their own personal and unique article titled “So You Want to Be a Games Journalist” simultaneously.</p>
<p>There are currently 12 entries, and you can read <a href="http://www.mathewkumar.com/2006/10/30/170/">my take</a> at my workblog, but readers might particularly be interested in the Triforce’s <a href="http://www.thetriforce.com/newblog/?p=813">extended metaphor</a>, John Walker’s <a href="http://botherer.cream.org/?p=631">frontal attack</a> on the original piece, and Kieron Gillen’s completely straight (and certainly useful) <a href="http://gillen.cream.org/wordpress_html/?p=1192">guide</a>. But there’s also <a href="http://pcgtim.wordpress.com/2006/10/30/how-to-be-a-games-journalist/">Tim Edwards</a>, <a href="http://thermosflaks.blogspot.com/2006/10/so-you-want-to-be-games-journalist.html">Tom Bramwell</a>, <a href="http://www.affectionatediary.com/?p=178">Suki</a>, <a href="http://dubiousquality.blogspot.com/2006/10/so-you-want-to-be-games-journalist_30.html">Bill Harris</a>, <a href="http://www.disappointment.com/wordpress/archives/171">Jon Blyth</a>, <a href="http://www.richardcobbett.co.uk/codex/journal/filingcabinet/so_you_want_to_be_a_games_journalist/">Richard Cobbett</a>, <a href="http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/soyouwant.htm">Stuart Campbell</a> and <a href="http://idealproject.blogspot.com/2006/10/so-you-want-to-be-games-journalist-im_30.html">Jon Hicks</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve never heard of any of them? Well, as <a href="http://www.mathewkumar.com/2006/10/30/170/">my guide</a> explains, that’s practically the <i>point</i>.</p>

<p>We’ve had a go, and it’s a cute and very playable (if not particularly special) little platformer, well worth playing, and well worth registering your interest in owning, as if enough interest is shown the game may be released in full as a cartridge or an online download.</p>

<p>Little to no fanfare about the movie is available on the site, but the film was originally available in two parts as Ryû ga gotoku – jissha-ban on Famitsu’s website (we can’t seem to find it now, though*), and listed Takashi Miike, the director of Ichi the Killer, Audition, and so on, as “Integration Director”, with the director listed as Takeshi Miyasaka, the director of several V-Cinema Yakuza flicks.</p>
<p>Only the first part (of four) has been posted so far, it plays in a tiny little window, and is as resolutely uncommercial as anything Miike has ever put his name to. Which is strange, because it’s a promo movie! It’s got some cheap looking blood and violence in it, too,  so ask your parents first!</p>
<p><i>*EDIT: Apparently the Ryu ga Gotoku promo was taken off of Famitsu’s website on as Sega decided to sell it in on DVD in Japan for 4,935 yen. Thanks to Redlightning.</i></p>

<p><b>“Good remakes of good games that anyone can play, regardless of their ability”</b></p>
<p>That initially sounds simple, but becomes a bit more complex when you think of varying abilities of people who play games, but you’ll have to do your best if you want you win one of the amazing prizes (there’s a total prize fund over £4000). There’s a <a href="http://www.dreamcodex.com/rrcompo/list.php">list</a> of games already entered and a <a href="http://retroremakes.com/forum2/forumdisplay.php?f=87">competiton forum</a>, including an invaluable <a href="http://www.retroremakes.com/forum2/showthread.php?t=6551">Top Ten Accessible Features Wish List</a> which is something all developers should be forced to read, really.</p>

The results are now <a href="http://www.tojam.ca/games/">online</a> though, and my favourite by far is <a href="http://www.tojam.ca/games/bubble_thing.asp">Bubble Thing</a> by Jonathan Mak, a strange sort of reverse take on Asteroids. Brandon’s note: The official site for that game is <a href="http://www.queasygames.com/bubbleThing">here</a>, and the author tells us there are mac and linux-x86 versions, too.></p>
<p>If that’s not your cup of (carbonated) tea, then you might fancy the bullet hell of Zi-Xiao Liang’s <a href="http://www.tojam.ca/games/super_hamster.asp">Super Hamster Air Combat</a>.</p>

Now in 3d with <i>bobblehead technology</i>, it’s worth a playthrough if you have any fond memories of the original. No confirmed u.s. release date, but the europeans are getting it in 7 days, the lucky so-and-sos. A direct download of the title is available <a href="http://www.codemasters.co.uk/downloads/index.php?downloadid=22512">here</a> (requires registration) so you’re better off getting the torrent from the lovely chaps at <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/file_service_files.php?action=show_file&file_id=488">eurogamer.net</a>.</p>
<p><b>Top Tip</b>: When installing, choose the language of the team that you want to play as. So french, if you want to see Zidane’s cute wee bald spot.</p>
