An extremely simple game with the surprisingly compatible goals of classic arcadey action and the creation of deep feelings of unease, BRAINPIPE actually came out late last year, but I didn’t notice until today, when one of the people who worked on it came over to my desk and made me download the demo. The demo is free, and the full game is $14.95. At the very least you should check this out, and make sure you have the sound turned up. Remember, these people are AWARD WINNERS.</p>

		<p>According to <a href="http://www.bethsoft.com/jpn/news/20081110a.html">this press release</a> from BethSoft Japan, tells us that apparently, Japanese people are still kind of sensitive about that whole atomic bomb thing. As a result, a quest where the player can choose to destroy an entire town is being cut from the Japanese version of the game. Additionally, the Fat Man weapon will be renamed, and some of the gorier kill animations for humans and certain ghouls will be cut. It’s currently unknown if this will affect the Asian release as well.</p>

Insert Credit first covered <a href="http://www.wadjeteyegames.com/">Wadjet Eye Games</a> back in September of 2007. It’s worth noting that we did not so much cover them as I <a href="http://www.insertcredit.com/archives/002006.html">talked about</a> how I really liked The Shivah. As a result, I was put in contact with Dave Gilbert (to answer Brandon’s question, no, he is not related to Ron). Dave set me up with free copies of the other two Wadjet Eye games, Blackwell Legacy and Blackwell Unbound. Now I’m telling you about them, because they’re really excellent.</p>
<p>In brief: each game follows a member of the Blackwell family and their Ghost Buddy Joey. The Blackwells are a family of mediums, and with Joey’s help they investigate the lives and deaths of confused spirits, giving them closure of some kind which allows them to move on. The thing about the games that most impresses me is the way Gilbert has you play a story. In most adventure games, you’re working on the story, and you have to take a break to figure out how to use a frozen cat to open a steel door. The puzzles in Wadjet Eye games are always deeply ingrained in the story, and a realistic investigation method. Who do you need to talk to, and what should you ask them. While there is still an inventory, it’s almost vestigial, with a notebook of clues and leads replacing the majority of the random items the normal adventure game protagonist would carry in his bottomless pockets. The only real failing is that, aside from an easter egg in Blackwell Unbound, there are no badass Rabbis.</p>
<p>Recently, The Blackwell Legacy was distributed on Big Fish Games, a large casual game portal. The game managed to hang onto a top ten spot in the puzzle category for a few weeks despite the fact that Big Fish drops a game every day, and Blackwell did not have the industry standard 60 minute trial. Following that, they were picked up for distribution by Playfirst, and are currently working on an adventure game specifically for the casual crowd. Not willing to leave distribution entirely, Wadet Eye has picked up distribution for a new adventure game by <a href="http://www.livelyivy.com/">Lively Ivy</a>, the studio of Erin Robinson, sprite and background artist on Blackwell Unbound and creator of Spooks and Nanobots. I’m pretty sure she’s Canadian.</p>

Will it be the greatest version ever? The answer is no. That’s the GameCube version, Drill Land. Second Greatest? Still no, that’s Mr. Driller Ace on the the GBA. Greatest version in English? MAYBE! Or maybe that will still be Drill Spirits on the DS. What it will be for sure is the only version with an online component. For single player options there will be both Classic Driller and some kind of Quest Mode. Will this be the same as the RPG mode we’ve in previous games (done best in Drill Land as Hole of Druaga)? Who knows. Frankly, the only thing we’re certain of is that it will be really colorful and awesome. You can tell just from that shot of the title screen. You should get it.</p>

I was sitting there wondering how Nintendo would top a Virtual Console week where they released two previously unseen in the U.S. games, so I decided to check <a href="http://www.gonintendo.com/">GoNintendo</a> for what came out today. Three pages in, there it was. Neo Geo Games have finally come to the U.S. Virtual Console. That’s the good news. The bad news is, all of these games were made completely obsolete by years of far superior sequels. Still, it’s cool to see them actually coming out.</p>
<p>Brandon’s note:> These games were ported by D4 Enterprise, a company which has absolutely nothing to do with D3. They made the one-chip MSX though! Also, for those of you who didn’t pick up Sin and Punishment last week – pick up Sin and Punishment. It’s an excellent, excellent Treasure shooter that was (quite truthfully) brought to the virtual console just for us – and people like us. Just so you know, the best way to play it is to use the analog stick on the left of the VC pad to aim, and use face buttons to move left and right.</p>
