I admit I have lost count of all the versions of <i>Mushi Futari</i> Ikeda has been churning out — not to mention interest. But for those who still care (yes, I mean the three of you in the back), Gaijin Punch has posted his <a href="http://www.gamengai.com/bn_inf.php?type=article&id=1636&l=e">impressions</a> from the recent location test (which should be wrapping up just about now) on <i>gamengai</i>, including a couple of videos and pics of the poster and pop. The main attraction is the new God mode, which, as GP explains, is somewhere between Maniac and Ultra in terms of difficulty.</p>

		<p>I’ve been meaning to post this link since the release of the PS2 port of <i>Arcana Heart</i> back in october. nohoho from <i>SRK</i> has posted a tutorial on <a href="http://curryallergy.blogspot.com/">his blog</a> which explains to non-Japanese speakers how to register on <i>Nico Nico Douga</i> and start viewing videos (inc. match/tournament fights from all the hottest fighting games). The tutorial is <a href="http://curryallergy.blogspot.com/2007/09/how-to-use-nico-video.html">here</a>. There’s lots of other cool fighting game-related posts on nohoho’s blog, including coverage of <a href="http://curryallergy.blogspot.com/search/label/bf">Battle Fantasia</a>, the high-res 2.5D fighter by Arcsys which unfortunately ended up tanking hard.</p>

		<p>There’s a whole s*itload of them coming out soon. The current issue of <i>Arcadia</i> revealed not only <i>Arcana Heart 2</i> but also <i>Akatsuki Denkou Senki AC</i>, an arcade port of the excellent doujin fighter also known as <a href="http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~subtle/akatsukibk/akatsukibk.html">Akatsuki Blitzkampf</a> (from the Subtle Style doujin group, who we’ve discussed many times). Meanwhile, from the contents list of Enterbrain’s upcoming <a href="http://www.enterbrain.co.jp/jp/p_catalog/book/2007/978-4-7577-3881-2.html">Tougeki Tamashii Vol. 7 DVD</a> (coming out october 31) we learn of <i>Melty Blood: Act Cadenza 2</i> (tentative title, this one). And of course there’s still <a href="http://www.capcom.co.jp/basara-x/">Sengoku Basara X</a> to (maybe) look forward to… Add to all this the recent shooter announcements and Sega’s, SNK’s, Namco’s and Taito’s multiple upcoming next-gen offerings (not to mention Konami’s dynamic re-entry into the arcade market) and, dear readers of insertcredit.com, I hope you may excuse this correspondent’s enthusiasm in proclaiming the imminent approach of some sort of an arcade renaissance… which will be japan-only, I am afraid.</p>
<p>PS. If you are still not convinced may I remind you that <a href="http://www.igs.com.tw/product/orlegend2/">Oriental Legend 2</a>, IGS’s brand-new 2D beat ’em up, is still on track for a mid-october release. On new arcade hardware, no less (the low-res-only PolyGame Master 2). With a card system to save character level, collected items and high scores, even.  If this is not some sort of a prophetic sign, then <i>you</i> tell me what a sign would look like. <i>It’s happening, I tell you.</i></p>

The PS2 port of <i>Arcana Heart</i> is going to be out in a few days, and you can read reviews of the arcade version on <a href="http://insomnia.ac/reviews/custom/arcanaheart/">insomnia.ac</a> (by none other than myself) and tim’s <a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=190">actionbutton.net</a> (by david cabrera, a.k.a sub for those who used to post on IC’s forums before the meltdown). Play-Asia has been taking <a href="http://www.play-asia.com/SOap-23-83-25-71-40-49-en-84-j-70-245h.html">preorders</a> for ages, and they are also offering the <a href="http://www.play-asia.com/SOap-23-83-25-71-8l-49-en-84-j-70-1uoh.html">soundtrack</a> and Hori’s <a href="http://www.play-asia.com/SOap-23-83-25-71-m-77-3-49-en-15-arcana+heart-84-j-70-26h3.html">limited edition stick</a>, though that last one seems to have sold out already…</p>
<p>In related lolicon 2D fighting news, the long-rumored sequel (which will simply be titled <i>Arcana Heart 2</i>) has been officially announced by The Company Formerly Known As Yuki (that’s what I’ll be calling them from now on, Examu is a horrible horrible name; it reminds me of… school for some reason), and it’s supposed to be hitting arcades across japan this winter, more or less exactly a year after the original’s release. Brandon’s note: Technically that’d be the company formerly known as <i>part</i> of Yuki, because <a href="http://www.examu.co.jp/">Examu</a> is a branch, and <a href="http://www.yuki-web.co.jp/">Yuki</a> is still going on making Shougi games and whatnot.> </p>
<p>The preview in this month’s <i>Arcadia</i> reveals a new character/arcana, at least some redrawn sprites, and most importantly an extra button. All well and good I say — the game looks awesome and the announced changes sound very promising — but I can’t for the life of me understand why they chose to reveal the sequel before the port was even out. Scheduling issues, I guess.</p>

Idea Factory is at it again with a fourth SRPG for the Xbox 360, this one titled <a href="http://www.ideaf.co.jp/apocaly/">Apocalypse ~Desire Next~</a> and set in the Neverland universe. Previously, IF had released two ports of PS2 titles on the 360 as well as one completely new game, all of which we’ve <a href="http://www.insertcredit.com/archives/001581.html">talked about before</a>. It is indeed strange that they are still on the 360 bandwagon (insert joke about MS moneyhats here). After <i>Mist of Chaos</i>, their first PS3 SRPG (which, incidentally is being localized for Korea — a tiny tiny market — without a word about an English release!), I had assumed that they’d stop supporting the 360, since the PS3 has a much larger user base in Japan and since their 360 games never get localized anyway. But there you have it. With IF’s four titles, the upcoming <a href="http://www.success-corp.co.jp/software/xbox360/operation-darkness/">Operation Darkness</a> and <a href="http://www.takaratomy.co.jp/products/gamesoft/zoid_alt/">Zoids Alternative</a>, and the already year-old <a href="http://www.culdcept.com/saga/">Culdcept Saga</a> (which should have been out in the US since last March, but which we are still waiting for — and will be waiting for for quite a while: Q1 2008 is what the lazy gits in charge of localization are saying now) an NTSC-J Xbox 360 is shaping up to be a highly desirable console for fans of turn-based strategy games.</p>

		<p>Turns out that Cave’s new shooter will not be a forced scrolling game, meaning that the player will be responsible for moving the field (this has been confirmed via the latest issue of <i>Arcadia</i>). Technically, this means that from now on I can’t call it a ‘shooter’, or a ‘shooting game’, or ‘STG’, or that word which shall not be mentioned here except when referring to that website which was responsible for making it ubiquitous. (I wonder what percentage of the site’s readership has any clue of what I am talking about right now. Hopefully it’s quite high! — though I guess we’ll never know.)</p>
<p>ANYway, the <i>Deathsmiles</i> plot thickens. Cave has posted an <a href="http://cave-gameshow.cocolog-nifty.com/">interview</a> with the game’s main programmer, who — surprise surpise! — is neither Ikeda nor Yagawa. This is something of a revelation, dear arcade fans, since every one of the company’s STGs all the way back to <i>DonPachi</i> has been programmed by one of those two fine gentlemen (<i>Dangun Feveron</i> might be an exception, but I can’t be bothered to check right now).</p>
<p>So what does this mean then? Cave’s hiring Yagawa, back in 2004 I think it was, led to the company churning out two shooters a year, instead of the usual one — might this new guy (whose name is Ishimura Takashi, and who has worked for Cave before, though he has never shouldered so much responsibility) help Cave put out even more arcade titles per annum? And how cool would it be if both Ikeda and Yagawa were working on other games right this moment? And can this <i>IC</i> update possibly include any more wishfully unrealistic thinking?</p>
<p>One thing is certain: Cave is expanding, and in more ways than one. Consider their snazzily redesigned <a href="http://www.cave.co.jp/">website</a>, their <a href="http://www.insertcredit.com/archives/001520.html">2006 end-of-year party</a>, their <a href="http://www.gamengai.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1864">upcoming 2007 event</a>, again at HEY arcade,  as well as the self-publishing of their latest superplay DVDs (which used to be published by INH). These are all signs of healthy growth, and to those of us who love arcades, shoot ’em ups, and 2D gaming in general, they could not be more welcome.</p>
<p>Getting back to <i>Deathsmiles</i>, translations of the interview I mentioned above (with the game’s main programmer, in case you were not paying attention) can be found <a href="http://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?p=272388#272388">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gamengai.com/bn_inf.php?type=translation&id=1617&l=e&p=2">here</a>.  Choice quote:</p>
<p><i>This game is aimed for those that take joy in destroying enemies rather than dodging bullets. It was made to be enjoyed from beginners of the shooting genre and the core players as well. Please try it out at the show later this month.</i></p>
<p>Yes, yes, we definitely will! (Or at least some of us will — I won’t be able to make it this time, but I know others who will.) So that’s all from Cave for the moment. I’ll close this update, appropriately enough, with a <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/fh_x4/">link</a> to a piano arranged track of the first stage of Ikeda’s <i>Mushihime-sama Futari</i>, courtesy of <i>Chord Pianissimo</i>, a cool little website which we’ve had the pleasure of mentioning <a href="http://www.insertcredit.com/archives/001686.html">before</a>. Enjoy.</p>

You might have met decinoge if you hung out on the old Insert Credit forums – he’s a sprite artist from Portugal with a strange but utterly pure love of Communism, outdated rendering techniques and Watermelon Fanta. More relevantly, he just released <a href="http://deci.blindado.net/">ZAMURAI</a>, a beta of a flash-based game he’s been working on as a college project. It’s a strange platformer featuring a bevy of classic characters reimagined using the old CGA graphics set (which you might remember from classic IBM-compatible games like Alley Cat). Combat and control aren’t too hot (use the arrow keys and left Ctrl) but the old-school aesthetic is captured perfectly. I predict that someday soon this man will do amazing things, then resurrect Stalin just to spoil it all.</p>

This one is the 2005 build of Sonic Rush from E3, and it’s notable for the music: while the finished product shipped with Hideki Naganuma’s funky J-Pop stylings the prototype was backed by a more traditional BGM, much in the style of the original Mega Drive series.</p>
<p> Naganuma’s soundtrack dropped a jaw or two, but there’s always been critical debate as to how well it fit the game (personally? I was sold as soon as I heard Malcolm X being sampled in the game over jingle). It’s interesting to imagine what might have been, especially as all signs seem to point to this being the last Sonic of any real quality for quite a while.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://forums.sonic-cult.org/index.php?showtopic=2418&pid=41386&st=0&#">Sonic Cult</a> for more info, just keep your arms and legs inside the car at all times. They’re a little… invested. They’ve stripped the soundtrack out over there, so feel free to grab that, if you’re interested.</p>
