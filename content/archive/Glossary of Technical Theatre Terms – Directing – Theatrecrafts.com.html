 are many different theatre shapes and styles, but the most important 
factor when designing a space for performance is the relationship 
between the audience and the actors on stage. The audience should be 
able to clearly see and hear all of the actors on the stage, in order to
 have a connection or relationship with them.<br>
A space where the audience is close to the stage (or feels close to the stage) is known as an INTIMATE auditorium.<br>
If the space is too big, it's harder for the audience to feel involved in the performance. <br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#DDDDDD; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">AD LIB</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">From Latin <em>Ad libitum</em> meaning "at one's pleasure".<br>

1) another actor fails to enter on cue<br>
2) the normal progress of the play is disturbed<br>
3) lines are forgotten<br>
4) It may also be a bad habit developed by some actors whereby unnecessary "gags" are introduced into the dialogue.<br>
<br>
In the past, any business or words that were not in the scripted act 'as
 known' would be seen as a breach of contract by some No.1 
Managements.&nbsp;<br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">ANAGNORISIS</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">Anagnorisis is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery. <br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#DDDDDD; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">ANIMATEUR</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">(From

Dorothy Heathcote at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1980s.<br>
This approach inverts the typical teacher-to-student model of teaching 
by allowing the students to dictate their learning and educational 
process through creative drama. The students, rather than the teacher, 
are the main communicators in this process.

Characterised by a rejection of 'traditional' artistic forms; gave rise 
to abtract art, atonal music, stream-of-consciousness writing etc.<br>
Initially modernist theatre was an attempt to employ naturalistic 
principles, as advocated by Emile Zola in the 1880s. However, a 
simultaneous reaction against naturalism attempted to integrate poety, 
painting, music and dance in a harmonious fusion. <br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#DDDDDD; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">MONOLOGUE</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">A speech within a play delivered by a single actor alone on stage.

 A naturalistic approach to lighting design requires lanterns to be 
placed in ways that duplicate where the light would come from in nature.
 For example, a sunny day outdoor scene would be lit primarily from 
above the acting area, with fill lighting in from the sides as if from 
the cloud. A dark room would be lit by moonlight through a window, and 
the light level would increase when a door is opened from a lit corridor
 or when a light fitting is turned on.<br>
2) <strong>Performance:</strong> A naturalistic performance (following 
the techniques of Stanislavski) requires that the actor completely 
understands and inhabits every aspect of the characters' life, as well 
as the motivation and lines that are to be spoken.&nbsp;<br>
3) <strong>Scenic Design:</strong> The set designer aims to reproduce reality as closely as possible.<br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">NOISES OFF</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">Stage

everyone is on form. The pacing of the show can have a real effect on 
how the audience react to it - it's a very tricky thing to maintain, 
especially as everyone gets more familiar with the show.<br>
A fast-paced scene takes energy and concentration, and can slow down as 
familiarity sets in, and a slow-paced scene may speed up. Directors 
often wish to cut down on unnecessary pauses and delays, but also to 
maintain the moments of silence between speeches when needed.<br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">PER DIEMS</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">See PDs.<br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#DDDDDD; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">PERIPETEIA</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;"></span></p><p>

 theatre is a genre of performance which makes use of the body (as 
opposed to the spoken word) as the primary means of performance and 
communication with an audience. In using the body, the performer or 
actor will concentrate on:<br>
The use of body shape and position<br>
Facial expressions<br>
Rhythmical movement, pace and the energy of the body<br>
Gesture<br>
Posture<br>
Gait<br>
Physical theatre can be distinquished from dance in that it tends to 
focus more on narrative, character and action. However, the boundaries 
between the two are rather blurred.<br>
There are various styles and genre of physical theatre. These include:<br>
Physical comedy - where the body is the primary means of comic creation<br>
Mime<br>
Stomp- where the body, with external objects, is used for its percussive potential<br>
Some forms of puppetry<br>
Circus<br>
The most famous institution devoted to physical theatre is the Lecoq 
school in Paris. Students here follow the method of Jacques Lecoq, which
 developed out of his experience of mask work, commedia dell'Arte and 
his interest in the physicality of performance.<br><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_theatre" target="_blank">Definition from Wikipedia - click for more</a><br><a href="http://www.ecole-jacqueslecoq.com/">Lecoq School</a></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#DDDDDD; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">PIANO-VOCAL</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">A
 vocal score, or piano-vocal score, is used by singers in a musical or

<span style="font-size:100%;">Advertising material for an event. The 
poster contains the name of the event, the date and time, cost of 
ticket, how to get a ticket, and where the event is taking place. It 
should also contain information (for example, a recommended minimum age)
 that may prevent a person booking. It should have an appropriate design
 for the type of event, and often contains a photograph or image as a 
background to the textual information. Some memorable posters are very 
simple in design. Website and social media links can also be included on
 the poster.<br>
Other advertising materials could include fliers (small versions of the 
poster, with additional information on the back), newspaper adverts, 
radio adverts, TV spots, T shirts, other apparel (baseball caps, 
beanies) etc.<br>
The UK design agency Dewynters is responsible for many iconic posters 
for West End shows - their approach is to make the poster image strong 
enough to be seen even if it's passing by at speed (e.g. on a bus or 
being seen from a car). Their most famous posters (e.g. Phantom of the 
Opera or Cats) are successful due to the strong 'logo' design which 
carries a simple message about the show, and can be recognised at a 
glance.&nbsp;<br>

For small venues the desk is used by the lighting designer and her/his 
team so that they can see the lighting from the audiences' point of 
view. The lighting control desk may be moved to the production desk, or 
the desk and programmer may remain in the control room, and have a 
remote interface on the production desk, which may have a display screen
 showing the cue list etc, which the designer can configure.&nbsp;<br>
Larger shows (including Broadway and West End) will often remove large

 Relaxed Performance is one specifically modified to help audience 
members with special needs to feel at home in the theatre, and to enable
 them to feel able to make noise and comment on the performance when 
they wish to. They are designed for audience members with autism, 
learning disabilities and sensory or communication needs. The sound 
level is often reduced, complex lighting changes are simplified, and the
 cast and company warn families when unexpected noises will occur. Often
 the house lights are left on, and the audience is given a pre-show tour
 of the theatre so that they are familiar with the environment. The 
performances sit alongside special measures for audio-description and 
signed performances for those with sight or hearing impairments, and 
were introduced to the West End in mid 2013. <br><em><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/16/relaxed-theatre-autistic-children" target="_blank">Guardian article on Relaxed Performances at the National Theatre, UK</a><br><a href="http://www.solt.co.uk/relaxed-performances" target="_blank">Society of London Theatre Relaxed Performances information</a></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#DDDDDD; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">1) The point during a drama when the plotline reaches a conclusion, and conflict is resolved.<br>2) A measure of the quality of a video display<br>3)

 piece of performance which has been designed to work only in a 
particular non-theatre space. The space may have been adapted to fit

 member of the cast of a musical (or a play with a large cast) who 
understudies multiple chorus roles in the production. When a chorus 
member is not well, has a day off or, in some cases, is performing in a 
principal role for which he or she is the understudy, a swing performs 
in this chorus member's place. In the cast of a musical, there will be a
 male swing who understudies all the male chorus roles in the cast, and 
also a female swing who understudies all the female chorus roles. In 
larger casts, there might be two or more swings for each gender. Swings 
are members of the cast who are in addition to those called for by the 
script, so in a performance where all of the chorus members and all the 
actors playing principal roles are present, the swings will not be 
performing in that particular performance -- although in most cases they
 will be waiting backstage to be available in the event they are needed.<br>

 of Cruelty is a form of theatre originally developed by avant-garde 
French playwright, essayist, and theorist Henry Becque.<br>
Antonin Artaud, some 50 years later, is also seen as a main contributor 
to the genre, notably with The Theatre and its Double. Originally a 
member of the surrealist movement, Artaud eventually began to develop 
his own theatrical theories. The Theatre of Cruelty can be seen as a 
break from traditional Western theatre and a means by which artists 
assault the senses of the audience, and allow them to feel the 
unexpressed emotions of the subconscious. While Artaud was only able to 
produce one play in his lifetime that reflected the tenets of the 
Theatre of Cruelty, the works of many theatre artists reflect his 
theories. These artists include Jean Genet, Jerzy Grotowski, and Peter 
Brook.

 is a form of drama based on human suffering that invokes in its 
audience an accompanying catharsis or pleasure in the viewing. While 
many cultures have developed forms that provoke this paradoxical 
response, the term tragedy often refers to a specific tradition of drama
 that has played a unique and important role historically in the 
self-definition of Western civilization.<br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#DDDDDD; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">TRAGI-COMEDY / TRAGICOMEDY</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">Tragicomedy
 is a literary genre that blends aspects of both tragic and comic forms.
 Most often seen in dramatic literature, the term can variously describe
 either a tragic play which contains enough comic elements to lighten 
the overall mood or a serious play with a happy ending.<br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">TRIGGER WARNINGS</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">Some audience members may be upset by particular themes that may be featured in some plays.<br>
It's important that the creative team are aware of these themes, and how
 they may affect audience members, and if necessary consult with local 
support groups or charities that can provide advice on how to deal with 
the issues sensitively.<br>
Although some venues may list the themes in advance publicity, others 
(such as The Old Vic in London) prefer to keep the trigger warnings 
unseen unless audience members ring the theatre in advance.<br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#DDDDDD; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">TRYOUT</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">A
 fully-staged run of a show in a provincial location before the show 
opens in a higher-profile location such as the West End of London or 
Broadway in New York.<br>
The tryout run allows the show to be fine-tuned, to amend (or cut) 
sections which are unnecessary or don't work, and can also build 
word-of-mouth, and enable the production to have publicity photos etc 
before the show arrives at its' final destination for a (hopefully) long
 run.<br>
Although many Broadway shows use out-of-town tryouts (e.g. Dear Evan 
Hansen (Washington DC), Frozen (Denver)), there are notable exceptions. <a href="http://www.theatrecrafts.com/pages/home/shows/spider-man-turn-off-the-dark/" target="_blank">Spider-Man Turn Off The Dark</a>
 was too technically complex to be set up in another venue, so the show 
had a hugely extended run of previews on Broadway, and suffered with 
many technical and logistical issues, as well as the departure of a key 
member of the creative team. However, shows such as <em>Book of Mormon</em> and <em>School of Rock</em> opened 'cold' on Broadway and have gone on to huge success. The cost of tryouts is increasing (see <a href="https://www.onstageblog.com/columns/2015/9/5/the-out-of-town-tryout-a-thing-of-the-past" target="_blank">OnStage Blog</a>) so a tryout is no longer the only option.<br>

nanny) he's said to have been cast AGAINST TYPE.<br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#DDDDDD; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">UNIT OF ACTION</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">Units
 of action, or units (sometimes also called beats), were first suggested
 by Konstantin Stanislavski as a means of helping actors determine the 
through line or super objective of a role. A unit is a discrete piece of
 action in a play-text, marked by a significant change in action. This 
could be a change in what the characters already on stage are doing or 
trying to do, i.e. a change in their objective, a new character entering
 the scene or those already on stage exiting.<br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">VERBATIM THEATRE</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">A

 known as Distancing Effect or Alienation Effect, this is a concept 
coined by Bertholt Brecht  "which prevents the audience from losing 
itself passively and completely in the character created by the actor, 
and which consequently leads the audience to be a consciously critical 
observer."<br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">VIEWPOINTS</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">(From Wikipedia) <span class="_Tgc">Viewpoints
 is a technique of composition that provides a vocabulary for thinking 
about and acting upon movement and gesture. Originally developed in the 
1970s by choreographer Mary Overlie as a method of movement 
improvisation, The Viewpoints theory was adapted for stage acting by 
directors Anne Bogart and Tina Landau.</span><br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#DDDDDD; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">VIGNETTE</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">A
 short impressionistic scene that focuses on one moment or gives an 
acute impression of a character, idea, setting, or object. This type of 
scene is more common in recent postmodern theatre, where less emphasis

story development. Vignettes have been particularly influenced by 
contemporary notions of a scene as shown in film, video and television 
scripting.<br><em></em></span></p></div><div style="background-color:#EEEEEE; overflow:hidden; padding:10px;"><p><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">WALK-ON</span><br><span style="font-size:100%;">A small acting role with no lines.

to focus on the performance and to forget about anything outside the 
walls of the theatre.<br><em></em></span></p></div>
