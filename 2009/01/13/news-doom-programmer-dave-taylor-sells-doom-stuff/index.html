		<p><img alt="ddt.jpg" src="/content/archive/ddt.jpg" width="196" height="270" hspace="5" align="left">The package includes the Acura NSX that Doom bought, which I’ve seen Dave (shown left) driving around Los Angeles. Unfortunately for any prospective buyers, it <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=180313018560">already sold</a>, alongside a doom shirt which proclaims “I wrote it,” and a doom sweater and framed copy of the sealed original game. Here are some item descriptions: </p>
<p>“<i>I am posting the car Dec 10, 2008, because it’s the 15 year anniversary of the release of the game Doom.  I was one of the programmers, and I bought the car new with proceeds from the game in my 20s when more testosterone was pumping through my veins.</i>“</p>
<p>“<i>I’m also including some of my Doom stuff with the car.  One is a Doom T-shirt with “Wrote it.” written on the back.  These were only given to the development team, and there were only about 8 of us.  It’s been washed many times and is one of those rare T-shirts that looks really good faded.  It is XL, but it has shrunk to about L.<br>
Another Doom goodie is a boxed copy of the original game for the PC that was framed unopened.  I doubt these are very common, because I am pretty sure you had to mail order them, and they’re a funny size and don’t come in shrink wrap.<br>
The last one is a hand-made, commissioned Doom sweater I had made in Dallas for about $400 by a lovely woman who hand-knitted it from scratch, doing a fine-grained, dithered blend from dark red to light red for the gradient.  It’s extremely meticulous and well done, and she had to look hard for just the right shades of yarn.  The colours are all spot on, and it’s a big sweater, can easily fit an XL.</i>“</p>
<p>“<i>I had a lot of grand adventures in this car, including key moments such as riding in the trunk, stuffing the passenger seat with two exotic dancers, and commuting between Dallas and Austin to make the game Abuse, amoungst many others.  I think there are a lot of adventures left in it.</i>“</p>
<p>The Doom saga will always be a curious one, and this particular piece of it is no less curious. I only regret that I didn’t ask to drive it before it was sold.</p>
