According to various <a href="http://kotaku.com/5135110/jaleco-holdings-is-leaving-the-video-game-business">sources</a>, Jaleco is leaving the game business, and has sold all game-related assets to online game purveyor <a href="http://www.gameyarou.jp/">Game Yarou</a> for one yen, assuming the latter company will absorb all the former’s debt as well. 1up has a surprisingly good <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8979071&publicUserId=4547783">writeup</a> of Game Yarou’s past and present relationship with Jaleco, which for some time has been owned by Hong Kong internet company PCCW. The forthcoming Kizuna was being banked on heavily by Jaleco, and there was rumor of some employee uprising at TGS, though it was quelled before I was able to investigate further. The DS edition of Ninja Jajamarukun was playable at TGS 2007, but not 2008 – but it seemed quite nice to me. Sadly the <a href="http://www.jajamaru-kun.net/">website</a> has not been updated, and still says 2008. The <a href="http://www.jalecogames.co.jp/">official Jaleco site</a> has not been updated with the news either. </p>
<p>Jaleco did lots of neat things, and hopefully won’t die out as the result of this transition, but I’m guessing it’ll exist more as a back catalog now. Games like Suchie Pai, Choplifter, P-47, Irritating Stick, and even <s>Punky Skunk</s> shouldn’t get brushed to the side. Curiously, Puchi Puchi Virus, slated for release by NIS America in the U.S. has still not seen the light of day. Will the relationship be further complicated by Jaleco’s psuedo-demise, or will it live on? Another legendary company down the toilet.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Not Punky Skunk! It was only released by Jaleco in the U.S. while it still had a division here.</p>

		<p><img alt="saturn.jpg" src="/content/archive/saturn.jpg" width="250" height="219" hspace="5" align="left">Lest we forget our history, my GDmag coworker Jeff reminded me that almost everything Kaz Hirai is saying about the PS3 was <a href="http://www.sega-saturn.com/saturn/other/tech.htm">previously said</a> about the Saturn. Take note of the quote I linked <a href="http://www.insertcredit.com/archives/002608.html">below</a>. Now read this statement from the aforelinked Saturn whitepaper: “<i>This growth won’t be possible on competing systems that offer a simpler architecture. It may be easier in some ways for developers to create programs for the competition because there’s less to learn and work with from a technology standpoint — but that means that developers are much more likely to run up against the limits of the system in a short span of time. The simpler structure of competing architectures also increases the chance that games will be “ported” from other systems (other game systems or even personal computers), which results in games that are generic and not optimized for performance and special features.</i></p>
<p>In contrast, the sophistication of the Sega Saturn pays off for both developers and consumers alike over the long term. Developers will continue to discover new ways to wield their creative talents, and game players will have an ongoing supply of new, inventive, out-there, beyond-cool titles for their Sega Saturn systems. “<br><br>That kind of logic is destined for failure. At the same time the Saturn is one of my favorite systems ever. Does this mean the PS3 will eventually be one of my favorite systems? The industry has changed enough that developers no long really “choose” a console, but rather develop somewhat agnostically and port as they can. The current climate does not seem conducive to the kind of quirky hardware differentiation of times past. So with that in mind, Sony had better learn from the past, or the ghost of Sega will come and have its revenge!</p>

Not very insert credit-y news, but Kaz Hirai has proclaimed PS3 to be the “official leader” of the game industry in a recent interview with Official Playstation Magazine, as reported by <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/hirai-were-the-official-industry-leader">eurogamer</a>. He basically just declared himself king, saying the facts don’t matter. Even more astounding is this statement: <i>“We don’t provide the ‘easy to program for’ console that [developers] want, because ‘easy to program for’ means that anybody will be able to take advantage of pretty much what the hardware can do, so then the question is what do you do for the rest of the nine-and-a-half years?”</i><br><br>Apparently if you can easily reach a console’s potential, you’ll just get bored! That’s no fun, not having to struggle against a machine and focus on things like design or art. Much better to peel it in layers, like an onion, or a Sega Saturn. So, with Hirai’s bold step forward, I hereby proclaim myself the <b>official leader</b> of game journalism. Readers, sphere of influence, none of that matters. Having proclaimed it, it must be so! Other journalists will fall by the wayside within 5 years or so, my 10 year plan is the true measure of success. Further, we don’t create an “easy to read” website so that readers can just enjoy reading things, there’s no fun in that. That’s why we make every entry as obtuse as possible so that readers can enjoy researching things on their own! I could go on like this forever. Sony is king. I am king.</p>
